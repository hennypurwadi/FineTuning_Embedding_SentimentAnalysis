Negative,0,Rude managerThe manager became agressive when I said the carbonara was not good. She was rude. It was  a very bad experience. The worst in Rome in many years.
Negative,0,"A big disappointmentI ordered a beef fillet ask to be done medium, I got it well done cooked and very dry, when I told them they took the steak and after 20 minutes they brought me another steak that was completely rare, I left all the steak , and they asked me about it but charged me the fool price."
Negative,0,"Pretty Place with Bland FoodThis is an attractive venue with welcoming, albeit but somewhat slow service. The offerings are pleasingly presented but most everything has no taste. It was as though ingredients were just assembled without seasoning: a lovely restaurant, except for the food."
Negative,0,"Great service and wine but inedible foodSadly I  used the high TripAdvisor rating too literally. We have been fortunate to eat at a number of fine restaurants so  know that amazing buzz from  a mouthful of fine freshly cooked food from a great chef.
Never before have we eaten a tasting menu and never will we again.
Ad Hoc has a great ambience with attentive friendly service and all the paired wines were exceptional.
Maybe we hit a night when the chef was off but every single course of food was certainly not freshly cooked and , as we passed the kitchen on the way to the bathroom, noticed plates of  precooked food ready to go on the tasting menu plates. If it had been the odd dish that disappointed, we would have accepted that it might have just been our palates not liking it. As it was every plate of food was not hot, bland, lacking any spark and had probably been sitting around for a while.l
All the serving staff were great as was the wine but I failed to finish any plate offered. 
The tasting menu looked good value but a simple bowl of hot freshly cooked pasta would have done better justice to the wine.
When asked ,I admitted , with that great English understatement, that I had been disappointed. I found 17 euros had been deducted from the 190 euro bill so it was nice that they noticed.
Probably best to avoid the tasting menus and enjoy their great wine selection with some pasta and maybe cheese course.

I feel responsible that I made a poor choice not realizing that this is a place geared for tourists. 
An expensive mistake."
Negative,0,"Avoid- Worst meal in Rome - possibly everFrom the start this meal was bad- especially given the price. We visited for my husbands birthday after being recommended by our local hotel. The lady in charge appeared at our table as we arrived to basically up-sell the truffle menu. Plonked some truffles on the table and then with no explanation of how they would enhance the dishes gave us a rehearsed speech which she proceeded to repeat word for word at every single table. If the food had been good we could have forgiven this but it wasn’t. The best parts were the bland bits as at least they were inoffensive - nothing was seasoned and sauces were completely tasteless with strange and weird combinations. But the worst part of the meal was my husbands inedible medallions of ‘lamb’ dish. This was made up of a tiny amount of lamb gristle and fat wrapped around some mushy stuff we couldn’t identify. Fillet of beef was sort of well cooked (frankly hard to get wrong) but served with exactly the same sauce as the lamb, some reconstituted mash in strange tube shapes and tasteless, watery spinach. We asked for wine recommendations. The wines were ok but we weren’t told what they were, they weren’t explained to us (I had to ask what mine was and was told it was ‘local’) and we weren’t offered any to try. With so much choice nearby and so many better (and much cheaper options) I’d avoid."
Negative,0,"Shocking management, TERRIBLE service by mum and daughter!! FOR Tourist ONLY!!We visited this restaurant on Saturday night and we had the most disappointing service and food experience ever. It was my partner's bday celebration weekend. 

The restaurant is run by a blonde Manager and her daughter wich had the most terrible attitude, they both made sure we will never be back there.
We were sitting at the table near the window but the ac was off and outside about 35 degrees. Halfway through our meal (truffle tasting menu with wine pairing), we asked to move anywhere else because it was too warm there.
The young waitress (the daughter) asked the manager (her mum) to move us, but she replies a very sharp NO!!!!! Also, a dog pooped just in front of us, on the pedestrian side, but apparently, according to the same waitress, that was nothing that concerned the restaurant. Anyhow now not only was it crazy hot but with a nice poo view too.
So we could not move anywhere even though the restaurant was empty, for no reason. Asked to talk to her mum (The Manager) she never touches the table or acknowledges us. How can you deny to a couple with 230 euro bills to move to another table when your restaurant is empty? 
Finally, a gem of a waitress with curly hair approached the table and moved us to another spot, where we spent the rest of the evening in confinement because as I said one side of the restaurant was empty for the whole night.
I have been managing restaurants for my whole life, and I never gave such an awful service and attitude to my guests.

The tempo of service completely wrong, food was getting to our table way earlier than wine.
The wine was poured into the glasses and set in the station for about 20 minutes before being served, subjected to the bacterias and dust since everyone was passing by.

Food was good but if you are used to first-class and fine dining service keep out from this place!"
Negative,0,"We tired the tasting menu - avoidWe tired the tasting menu with wine pairing. The food was not interesting, not very tasty and overall wasted time and money. I would not come back and I would not recommend it"
Negative,0,"Huge DisappointmentThis restaurant’s high rating is wholly unwarranted.  We were looking forward to Ad Hoc’s truffle menu this week with white truffles in season and left sorely disappointed.  The food was flavorless, served cold, and overpriced to boot.  It seemed as if the dishes had been made in advance and reheated.  The truffles inferior in quality and taste.  We dined at other restaurants in Rome the same week that served far more flavorful truffles at a much lower price, so recognize the difference!  The service was slow and disjointed.  The only thing that checked out were the wine pairings, which were fine.  Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
Negative,0,"Expensive mediocre food and serviceWe got the Tasting Menu and wine pairing. Frankly, the food wasn't tasty and the wine was boring. The service was completely impersonal and almost robotic. I would avoid this place at all costs, there are too many really good restaurants in Rome"
Negative,0,"all around awfulMy wife and I booked well in advance based on TA reviews. We were seated as we arrived and the interior was wonderful. We each ordered the pumpkin flower stuffed with cheese. They arrived about 30 minutes later stone cold and tasted like hard potato chips stuffed with a glob of cheese. We ate about 20% and told the waitress, who never came back to check, when she came to clear the plates that is was awful. She argued with us saying""well, that is how we make it."" About another 30 minutes passed and our second course arrive, again stone cold-it was a pasta dish that was way under cooked, not just al dente. We did not eat more than a few bites but sat there for about 20 minutes until someone came by to clear the plates-we told her that the food was not edible and asked for our waitress--after sitting for about 10-15 more minutes we decided to get up an leave-the waitress never appeared until we started to walk out and then she said our main course was ready. This was 2 hours after we arrived. We paid for the first two course even though a classy restaurant would not have charged at all, and walked out. The waitress was rude and the food awful and the service even worse."
Negative,0,"A big disappointment due to poor service and arrogant attitudesRome

A big disappointment--not service-oriented and arrogant.

I had high expectations for this restaurant, but when we got there, it turned out that they had put our party of 6 at a very large table for 8 completely off on its own at the back of the restaurant. The table was not conducive to good conversation and very awkward. When we asked for another table, our concerns were dismissed. When I wrote to the restaurant afterwards to complain about the situation, I got a very dismissive letter back from the owner, essentially stating: ""other people love this table; I guess you didn't."" No apology was offered.   Particularly given the price, I would not recommend this restaurant to others based on the poor treatment we received particularly given the many other wonderful alternatives in Rome.  If you do choose to go, I would specify where you would like to sit."
Negative,0,Perfectly organized absolute scam!The place offers really low quality overpriced food wrapped in a good environment with pretentious service well placed to create the atmosphere of a serious and high end restaurant. Packed with tourists should have given me a hint from the very beginning . Specializing in truffles allows you to have a segment peel of real truffle on your plate amongst many many fake ones. Fillet 47 euros was entrecôte and not a good one at that as well. Stay away at all costs !!!
Negative,0,"DisappointingWith so many complimentary reviews I was expecting so much more. The service so praised in other reviews was robotic and slow....Very slow. Our reservation was for 21:00. Our table wasn't ready, so we were invited to have a glass of prosecco in the bar. This was fine but we waited half an hour for the table. Once we got to the table we waited 20 minutes or so to have our order taken, although to be fair we were offered another glass of prosecco. We eventually got our amuse bouche at around 22:00 at least an hour after we arrived. 

We ordered the truffle set menu. The food ranged between being average and quite good, never really good. At odds with other reviews a few words of warning. The truffle menu is a poor choice. Truffle is delicious but a whole meal with the same flavour doesn't work. Second unless you are very hungry avoid the menus. The volume of food is enormous. We left quite a lot of the anti pasti and especially the pasta course. 

We eventually left around midnight. They clearly book more covers than they can efficiently deal with. 

My summary is...quantity rather than quality and slow robotic emotionless service probably caused by over booking."
Negative,0,"What a disaster...I have to say that I was disappointed in my visit to Ad Hoc. While the location and decor were great I found the service to be terrible, in fact the service made the food a disappointment as well. 

It started with the 40 minute wait in between sitting down and a staff member our order for food or drinks. Our waitress seemed disappointed we didn't want to do the tasting menu, but we were already disappointed with the way the meal had started. It took another 30 minutes for our first glass of wine and burrata appetizer to arrive at the table. 

The burrata with the upgrade of white truffle. This dish was around $50, and when it arrived a small fly landed on it... No big deal it happens. When the waitress and I tried to get it off it was killed on the cheese. She asked if we wanted a new one... um, of course I said. Now after waiting 30 minutes for the dish to arrive at our table a ""new one"" was brought out in less than 5 minutes. I'm not sure that the 2nd burrata was new and that they threw away the original dish, given how expensive white truffles are, but it should have been. 

The 3 way carbonara came out practically cold too. No one ever came to see if we wanted another drink until the end of our meal. When we ordered wine glasses were just brought over a glass, no wine was ever presented to the table as with other restaurants in this price range. Some staff apologized at one point saying the service issues were because they were busy, I'm not sure how that was my problem. They hold themselves out as a fine dining experience and at least mine was far, far from that. I would tell you to ignore the inflated reviews and look for something better."
Negative,0,"Great wines but average foodWe both ate the truffle tasting menu with wines. The appetizer where good but the first and second course where nothing special at all. A decent meal with some truffle for a BIG price tag. The dessert where fine and the wines was really good.
But for this price everything should be GREAT."
Negative,0,"Utterly inept in every wayAnd pretentious to go along with it.  What can you say about a restaurant that provides separate wine lists for red and white that look like copies of War and Peace?  Except that there are two wines per page, and they aren’t listed by country of origin, or varietal type – they’re listed by what someone (God knows who) thinks is the type.  Who would have guessed a Chianti Classico is a “full bodied red”?  Certainly no one who knows wine.  In any normal restaurant this wine list would run maybe 6 or 7 pages at the most.  Apparently wines by the glass are a state secret, you have to ask if they have them.   

Rubbery, overcooked octopus, brittle fried pumpkin flowers, devoid of taste, topped with cold ricotta, a filet that could only be described as a low-end USDA Choice from a chain steakhouse in the US, also rubbery and tasteless.  At least the fish was cooked properly, but was lying on a hockey puck of warm wilted spinach.

Appallingly bad service, one hour to get the appetizer.  They seem to be totally confused about everything.    And 160 euros for the experience.  There is a traditional Italian restaurant about two doors up that was packed.  Ad Hoc wasn’t.  I can see why."
Negative,0,"Emperors New ClothesNice atmosphere and the staff were attentive but after that not a lot more to say. I hope you have heard the story of ‘The Emperors New Clothes’. Everyone saying how great everything is but in truth the food is very mediocre. Perhaps we went on a wrong night. Who knows?

The food was bland and the wine was very average. The wine served was just a normal run of the mill, nothing special. Have tasted a lot better for a lot less."
Negative,0,"Too touristicAn ambitious restaurant in Rome’s downtown without a real soul; menù is a mixed of meat and fish but without a real specialization
Our impression is that the place is too touristic not a real gourmet high quality experience
Service appropriate"
Negative,0,Forget truffle CarbonaraTruffle menu is nice to try but Carbonara was over cooked  and a bit messy to eat. Meat with  truffle could be softer. Desert not the best option. Service was ok and also the wine menu
Negative,0,"One of the worst meals of my lifeService is fine, decor fine, but the food is extremely bad, almost inedible. Extremely disappointing. The wine list good, but that's it."
Negative,0,"2 hours of disappointmentCame here based off of TripAdvisor reviews and I'm debating deleting the app as it's clear the people who rate this place highly are delusional.

I'll start by saying that the hospitality and staff was amongst the best I received during my 10 stop Italian tour. The free glass of wine, the free pre desert and the free bottle of house olive oil was appreciated and the staff were excellent in every way especially the bald waiter with the blue eyes who was amazing at his job but the food was total crap!

We each got the black truffle tasting menu, it was our last night so we decided to splash out a bit and the table behind us (an American family) also got the black truffle tasting menu. The starters were ok. 2 of them were the same but one had basil and the beef tartar was bland.

The truffle carbonara was very nice, but the spaghetti dish was average. The ox cheek was tough with a sirloin type fat down one side. At this time the table behind us got a steak and we noticed them complaining that it was tough so it wasn't just us. For this reason I believe the meat to be poorly sourced. The duck however was decent.

The deserts were all crap, we actually didn't finish them. Meanwhile the Americans on the table behind us were blown away by the same dishes we disliked which leads me to believe that the reviews of this place are mostly by Americans ""visiting Europe"". 

I never know which reviews to trust so if you're reading this take the opinion of someone who has eaten at Michelin star restaurants around the world and has a knack for finding hidden gems, this place, in a nut shell, the food is below average with truffle on top. The service and hospitality is excellent but you can't eat good service. Presentation was also excellent, however id say avoid this place."
Negative,0,"Just so so and blandHad the truffle tasting and it tasted flat. Definitely expensive. Even for the type of upscale restaurant that it tries to be, it's expensive for the quality of the food."
Negative,0,"Regrettable food-- cold pasta carbonara in RomeI don't write negative reviews. I'd rather say nothing because everybody can have an off night and I've worked in food and know how tough it can be. But one thing out of several missteps prompted me to write this. I hope I save someone who really wants to experience good Roman food from disappointment (and it's not hard to find good food in Rome!).  First, this is tourist food; upscale to be sure. The focus on truffles is not really representative of Roman cuisine (if that's what you what).  You can get that type of menu in many upscale hotels in many places. I could tolerate that--it is what it is-- had our food been served appropriately.I went for the Roman menu hoping for tradition and creativity to meet well. My partner went for the land menu. Both suffered the same problem.  Some of this food was cooked way ahead. That can be done with some things but not others. Dishes that should have been hot were served cold. I'm talking cold gummy pasta carbonara, people! Another dish--intended to be hot- was warm in one part and not just cold but ice cold in another. That is just not excusable. Service this evening was also chaotic, but I felt bad for the 3 young women who were dealing with some 8-10 top  tourist groups and only one of them seemed to be a professional server. I've been coming to Rome for 30 years and I have NEVER experienced anything like this. We decided to pay and leave after the pasta debacle (I actually sent it back and waited 45 minutes for the server to return with a replacement--never happened), even though we weren't halfway through the fixed menu. The poor server was very apologetic and refused to let us pay. I'm hoping this was a problematic evening and won't occur again, although I'm pretty sure much of the food is made too far ahead (fried foods much be served subito-- the fritti were lukewarm going on cold) or the food isn't getting from kitchen to table promptly. I should have known better, but I trusted reviews and even recommendations from travel advisors I know. If you are planning for this to be your splurge in Rome, you might think twice about it. My advice: go simple in Rome; it's almost always good if not great."
Negative,0,"Far behind expectations - what did we miss?After several recommendations, and a quick read through on TA feedbacks - we booked Ad Hoc for our last night in Rome. We are both global travelers, and we know a good restaurant from a great. This ended up as neither of the two.
We arrived with expectations, and our expectations were raised even further after being escorted to our table. The interior is inviting - with romantic seating and wine bottles covering the wall from floor to ceiling. Prosecco as a complimentary aperitif is never wrong either.
We received the menu, and decided to go with the truffle tasting menu - despite being slightly off season. We went with full wine pairing, and from here and out our expectations were thrown off a cliff...
The one thing that surprised us the most, was the constant waiting(which we could easily notice being a distraction for the tables next to us as well) There was an extreme amount of dead time between the courses, and this is where we found the wine pairing to be a mistake. The wines offered as part of the wine package were well balanced with the courses served, but in small servings. With 30 minutes to the next course, and with no offers for a refill or other supplementary drinks. Weird!
Food? Started off well with a variety of starters. Cheese, deep fried veggies and truffles as front runners - the starter was heavy...but rather pleasant. Last one on the plate was a beef tartare. Unseasoned, as they felt we should season by taste ourselves... What???
Pasta course was a duo of pastas. Both creamy and cheesy and heavy - loaded with truffle shavings. I'd loved it if this was the only heavy course, but already by now - the meal is loosing balance. There are no vegetables, and no acidity to balance the weight of cream/cheese/truffles.
Main course. Duck breast and beef cheek loaded with truffles. Duck breast - cold and rubbery. Beef cheek - cold and tasteless(salty if anything at all) We sent it back, and started to loose patience.
Decided to wait for desserts. All good, but guess what - all creamy and heavy! A fresh sorbet could have saved half the day, but was unfortunately not part of the game.
All in all - I can only recommend the wines served(although served in a strange way...bottles were never brought to the table?)
We had the main courses removed from our bill - which helped on our mood...although I took that more or less for granted.
Sorry to say - this experience is no where near our top 10 in Rome..."
Negative,0,"Missed the markFriendly, welcoming staff. Nicely designed restaurant. Superb wine list. Quiet atmosphere. Food presentation beautiful.  So what went wrong......the food was just average and lukewarm. I thought there would be some kind of dress code but I guess there is no such thing these days! Then waited a very long time for the check."
Negative,0,"Won't be going backLet me start with the positives. The wine list is fantastic all regions of Italy are represented and many level price points will satisfy any oenophile. The food presentation is nice, but was lacking in taste and my food was not hot. My fiore di zucca was cold,beef tartare tasteless, homemade spaghetti with duck ragout cold,gnocchi dish ok. A pork dish ok but not hot. Passed on desserts. We then waited for 20 minutes for a check. The owner was very kind and gave us olive oil and a bottle of wine gratis. Also you would expect people to be dressed properly, shorts on a Sunday night come on. This is not a fine dinning restaurant."
Negative,0,Humiliating disappointing bad experienceWe were excited given the good reviews for this restaurant but the food was an attempt to produce something creative and special but they failed miserably.  The food has no taste.  Tried both the land and sea tasting menus.  Really frustrating when the service is soooo slow to have to wait for long between courses and have one flop after the other being served.  The staff act like they are serving exquisite dishes and take too much time explaining and make you wait forever which makes the whole experience even more worse.  The locale has character since you are sitting in the middle of a wine cellar but once you start the experience you realize that it is not authentic at all.   When we expressed concern over the slow service they became defensive and then offensive.  showing no respect and condescendence to customers.   Do not recommend at all.
Negative,0,"Rip-off in Ripetta street: the most over-rated restaurant ever.We (my wife, my son and I) had a terrible experience in ad-hoc on Thursday 5 January 2017. It is a miracle that this restaurant is in the Roma top 100 with such poor food, atmosphere, attitude, service, organisation, heating, etc...Only the wine was good. We had far far far better experiences during our stay in Roma, including at Babette, which is in the same area.
We booked by phone the day before for three and arrived on time at 800pm. We were seated in the room on the right side when you enter the restaurant and we felt immediatly uncomfortable with the temperature of the room despite a very visible (and working) heating system. There were permanent flows of cold and hot airs in the room. We complained to the head waitress (the boss?) who said they have a problem with the door (in fact, even when the door was completly closed, the issue with the temperature was more or less the same) and said she will do her best to move us to another table. This did not happen despite a table that we could see became available at some stage and stayed free for may be 30 minutes. At the end of the dinner (during which my wife kept her coat...) we asked why she did not move us to the other table and she said (believe it or not): ""because it is a table for four and you are only three""....translation: i do not care about your health but i care about making money even if i have to over-promise for this.
Generally speaking we found that the head waitress (the boss?) overpromised on everything during this dinner...and under-delivered.
Regarding food, the truffle experience was expensive and disappointing. We would rate the food somewhere between ""nothing special"" for the pasta and ""bad"" for the duck which was served dry when we asked medium rare. We noticed that people at the table next to us complained about the beef.
The Tuscany red wine was good...but do you need to introduce it with tons of words and superlatives as you would do for a Chateau Petrus 1982?
The service was very very long...it took one hour to get the first course and then another hour to get the second one and nothing seemed really properly organised and managed.
When we decided to stop the experience before the dessert and asked for the bill, the head waitress (the boss?) asked about our feeling. We told us exactly what was our view: big problem with the temperature, no transfer to the other table when it was available, nothing special (at best) with the food and good wine. She said several times she was confused but did not seem to be so confused...More a bad actress than a good head waitress (or a boss?).
The bill included a 10% discount which seems to be applicable when you make an internet booking...but we realized after we left the restaurant that our first courses were charged at €30 vs €25. Based on other reviews, we believe it is because the black trufle was partly replaced by white trufle. This was our choice but when this option was proposed by the waitress she never mentioned we have to pay an extra for this.
Finally, when we asked for our coats, a waitress gave us a probably very expensive Moncler down jacket...which was not belonging to us. Imagine what could have happened with clients less honest than we are...Don't go there with expensive coats!
Never again! and FYI we are used to go to all sort of restaurants privately or because of our jobs, from small local restaurants to 3* Michelin restaurants (see our other reviews) and we believe we are able to make the difference between good and bad food, good and bad service, etc..."
Negative,0,"DinnerIt Was Very expensive for the bad cooking, certainly an overestimated place, the environment Was nice but the people Was Very mean un the service."
Negative,0,pas terriblewe reserved for the birthday of my mother and we were disappointed. it may be good for young couple but not for family. main dish is too salty and the desert is too sweet.
Negative,0,"Too much fuss for nothingWe were so disappointed from this place that we have to write a review in order to protect tourists being trapped in the future and spending their money here! The food is rather average, nothing too noteworthy, prices are sky high (35€ for an average beef with some black truffle) and the choice really limited, you have to choose the menu at 79€ with wine but NO truffles for this one! The place is advertised as the truffle paradise but in order to have any truffle dish, you have to spend more than 75€ per person and to be honest the tastes don't worth it."
Negative,0,"Disappointing dinnerThis restaurant was recommended to us by two different people and while they must have had a good experience, we did not. 

It took 30 minutes to get our order taken. The server did apologize for the delay but the incredibly slow pace continued. 

45 minutes into our visit, we received bread. 1/2 of the bread was very dry and without much taste/flavour. 

On two occasions the server said our dinner would be coming right away but it never did. It took almost 3 hours before the main course was served. My husband ordered the Sea Tasting Menu and I had the Land Tasting Menu.  We both found the food to be excessively salty and very average overall.

Against our better judgement, we decided to order dessert. The tiramisu was too soupy/soggy and was probably the worst I have ever had.

The server never offered to refill our beverages and never asked if we were enjoying our meal. They ignored us for most of the evening. 

While the bathroom was clean there were no hand towels at all. 

It then took us a very long time to get the bill because the servers continued to avoid us.

We arrived for dinner at 8pm and left at 11:45pm. Unbelievably long dinner for food that was less than good for the price we paid. 

We definitely do not recommend this restaurant."
Negative,0,"Wish we had gone some place else for special occasionI really wanted to like this place, we had our 10 year anniversary in Rome and after I found out my first choice was closed for the summer holidays, we decided this would be perfect. 
Now we were a party of 4, 2 ordered the Truffle tasting menu, one the land menu and the other they created a truffle tasting menu for vegetarians, all with matching wines... bill came to 420 odd Euros...so wasn't a cheap meal but nor was is great...

Firstly and perhaps those that don't order the truffles will get a better experience but I found the menu to be unimaginative and merely they just put slices of truffle on everything. It started with being presented with a small table spoon of cold mash potato, compliments of the chef they said...um ok wasn't particularly tasty I left half of mine. 
then came the tasting plate, this was perhaps the nicest of all the dishes, a plate segmented into 3 with a cold battered pumpkin flower, a burrata, and the poorest excuse of steak tartar I have ever seen. simply a square of raw mince and 3 slices of truffle, no capers, nothing else. 
the pasta was presented , two of them , however they tasted exactly the same...i liked them but wondered why you would put two of essentially the same pasta of the same plate... this was also an issue as the pasta was on this silly little plate and whilst eating one side the other got cold so again that wasn't very nice.
Next the mains...2 tiny slices of dry over cooked duck breast with sliced truffle, on what appeared to be the same cold potato we got at the start, and a beef cheek thing, which was nice, but some what confused in the whole tasting menu...

You did however get a very good amount of truffles...this I can't fault them of... I however would recommend that people don't do the tasting menu, rather order from the main menu and perhaps order an item or 2 with truffles..

Finally we had what will perhaps be the worst Tiramisu I have every ordered, it tasted like it was one layer of biscuit and then they got some of the whipped cream in a can and sprayed on top....not nice, maybe at the Cheese cake factory but not at a decent restaurant.

Now the final and somewhat laughable moment, some of our group wanted to buy fresh truffles, they went to the back and were presented with fresh black truffles ....how much we ask ...600 euro a kilo....umm no
Next morning we go to Campo Di Fiori ask the vendor who talks to a guy, price 180 euro a kilo.....

So in short no I wouldn't recommend dining here, glad we caught up with our friends, just wish it was a better meal. I am sure my experience won't stop people from attending, and perhaps we  ordered poorly, I just didn't like it for the reasons given above."
Negative,0,Too highly ratedWe had dinner in this place in July. Food quality was clealy lower than many other places in Rome with similar ranking. Absolute disaster was the 'alternative' Tiramisu'. A cookie with some chocolate and a mountain of whipped cream.
Negative,0,Mr GennadiyShortly....the food is pretty average. The price was 111 euro for 1 person. Left hungry. All did just for appearance. Not worth to visit at all.
Negative,0,"Disappointing on our final night in RomeWe had booked our table at Ad Hoc some time in advance of our trip to Rome and decided we would keep it as our final night treat. We were invited to the pre-meal truffle tasting which was a nice touch and this started our evening off well with a free glass of prosecco to go with it. First impressions were good at the restaurant with another free glass of prosecco as we perused the menu. The wine list was extensive but there were choices for all palates and budgets, and we were very happy with our choice. Unfortunately that's where our positive experiences ended. We were left feeling very underwhelmed with the food when it arrived - whilst it looked good visually it simply lacked in taste. My pasta dish was nice but steak for main was cold on arrival. My girlfriend chose a truffle pasta that was far from impressive (and it should have been for the price!) and she couldn't eat the suckling pork chosen for mains - it came with no accompaniments meaning you had simply 2 big bits of meat on a plate). The staff offered to get an alternative as we didn't like the pork, but we had lost faith and decided against it. For the same reason we chose not to get dessert. The restaurant knocked off half the cost of the pork main from our bill, which was appreciated, but honestly we'd rather have paid full price and enjoyed our meal. After having high hopes it feels like the restaurant is a little style over substance. With sadness, this was a very disappointing end to our trip. It says something when you're happier with your gelato on the way home..."
Negative,0,"Bad experience....So many good reviews and still, yesterday night was a great disappointment. 
Service was slow, starters were good. 
Octopus was stiff and nor eatable ( but that changed us without any blink of an eye). 
Spaghetti with lobster wish very good.
Main dishes, that is the main issue.....
After one hour that we waited for our beef dish
And no one came over, we called the manager and she was sorry for not letting us no that "" their was a problem in the kitchen ""......
Another few minutes past and finely the under cook dishy came. 
We didn't eat those dishes, we paid the bill and live."
Negative,0,"Minority ReportFor restaurants as highly regarded as Ad Hoc, the majority of Tripadvisor reviews gush with unbridled delight, while a tiny minority will tell you it's all hype and a waste of money. Sadly, this time I have to side with the naysayers. 

There were three of us. Two ordered tasting menus paired with wines; one ordered a la cart. The consensus: no interesting flavors in anything we tried, salt being the dominant (and only clearly discernible) one. We did not complain, but it felt like the staff knew the kitchen was underperforming; everyone around was plied with multiple freebies. We received complimentary sparkling wine with a pre-appetizer, a pre-desert and a post-desert, an extra desert wine and a take home bag of goodies. The restaurant is very cute, has a nice vibe, and an interesting sounding menu that offers creative alternatives to traditional Roman food. It has an impressive wine collection and accommodating staff. It could have been a wonderful place—if it served good food. 

The cranky naysayers are prone to utter things like: ""It was the worst meal we had in ... "" Unfortunately, even this unkind sentence applies to our experience as well. During our 5-day Roman holiday, it was the worst meal we had. That is even taking into account that some of our meals were totally un-fancy, like a salmon sandwich served on a paper plate. But it was a pretty damn tasty sandwich. Since it is impossible to build a great reputation by serving mediocre food, I conclude that Ad Hoc had better days. In view of that, I don't know how to interpret our experience. Exploiting old, but now badly faded glory? Having a really bad day? The chef quit in the morning? Well, I won't find out, since a return visit is rather unlikely."
Negative,0,"very dissapointingAfter being in so many cities and restaurants i was expecting something else. I have no idea how this place got such good reviews. We got the truffles menue, the pairing wine was bad, the food was cold and the service was slow. Really bad place, for tourist who don't know much about food in general."
Negative,0,"Huge DisappointmentI booked this restaurant in advance for my boyfriends birthday after reading the amazing  reviews on TA and was so disappointed that I felt compelled to share my own experience of the tasting menu. To begin, the menus were missing a number of items one of which was a seared duck salad that was substituted with a cheese salad. Not a suitable replacement. Additionally there was only one type of truffle available which meant we didnt opt for this tasting menu. All of the food itself was bland and lacked seasoning with the exception of the pasta course and a number of dishes were cooked terribly. The beef cheek for example was like chewing leather despite being such a tender cut of meat. The service was also awful, with one of the waitresses contstantly slamming down our dishes and having a serious attitude problem. The only saving grace about this place is that the wines are fantastic and are very reasonably priced alongside the tasting menu. I would not return however for this alone and would head on down to Trastevere where the food is exceptional and a fraction of the price."
Negative,0,"Don't waste your money on expensive plates. Just drink some wine.I went with my wife and I was very excited to spend money on a rare and tasty dinner. We ordered beef fillet and honey duck with black truffels. The result... LOW QUANTITY AND QUALITY AT A VERY HIGH PRICE!!! 
However the variety of wine available was large."
Negative,0,"Our table was cancelled on short noticeOur table reservation for my birthday dinner at ad hoc's table 28 got canceled on short notice without any credible reason.  The reservation included a private wine and truffle tasting.  Ad hoc offered us the tasting menu in the restaurant as a replacement which is nice but the setting clearly not comparable with table 28.  What a disappointment!

We had a very nice truffle and lobster dinner at Radina, which our hotel was fortunately able to arrange on very short notice."
Negative,0,"Music was niceJust left this place and for sure won't never try again. The best part of the dinner was the lounge music! They present themselves like a sophisticated and gourmet restaurant, but I had much better experience in Rome...and at better price. Took starter, honestly quite nice, but with a kind of basket made of parmesan that probably should be more crispy than what it was: tasty, but so hard to eat that I thought it was prepared too much in advance. Then I took tonnarelli with truffle: they said ""Black Norcia truffle"", but no taste! Maybe not fresh? Or maybe just ""nero pregiato"" or some kind of second class truffle like that? 
Don't need to know, cause for sure I won't repeat ever same mistake"
Negative,0,"So disappointing it hearts...We ended up here after reading very good reviews on Trip Advisor but our dinner was an experience of tasteless disappointing food.
After we were seated we had to wait about 10 minutes until we were approached and handed over the menus. 
For first course we ordered a home made smoked salmon and pumpkin flowers. The salmon dish was BAD. It was placed on tasteless anemic small cubes of potatoes and carrots and on top if it was a yogurt sauce. The pumpkin flowers were served deep fried with the same yogurt sauce - very very BAD dish. We left most of the food on the plat but the waitress didn't even wondered why.
For the mains we ordered truffle dishes. A polenta with truffles and truffled pasta.
The polenta was tasteless. It was made out of corn flower and not from a fresh corn. The result was s mushy unpleasant chunk of corn flower purée.
The pasta was surprisingly good and it was the only food we completed eating.
After clearing the table from the main courses we had to wait 15-20 minutes for a waitress to approach us. After loosing hope to get someone's attention, we gave up desert and ask for the bill.
The only positive element at this place was the wide selection of wines they offer, unfortunately, it doesn't come with  a sommelier to assist the dinners. 
Overall it was a a very disappointing experience and the high rating the place is an unexplainable mystery."
Negative,0,"Not my tasteHard to review restaurants - everyone has a different palate. The service and presentation at Ad Hoc was beautiful, and the wine choices were excellent, but the food was just not to my taste. A little too heavy on the truffles for me."
Negative,0,"UnderwhelmingFirstly I'd just like to stress how excellent the staff were, very friendly,  great english and excellent at helping you pick a wine to your tastes.  However the food was really unimpressive especially considering the cost, 130 euros for antipasti, first and second courses and a bottle of wine, we didn't want to take the chance with dessert. The antipasti were the best part of the meal and everything else suffered from pretty big cooking errors that you wouldn't expect at an establishment of this calibre,  such as splitting the eggs for the carbonara so it was basically pasta stuck together solidly by scrambled eggs. Complimentary truffle tasting and bottle of sparkling wine were nice. Overall I would advise anyone visiting Rome to save your money and give this a miss, there are too many other good restaurants in Rome, many for around half the price with much better food."
Negative,0,"POOR SERVICE. Great atmosphere. Ok foodCan't understand it is number two of the pricey restaurants of Trip Advisor. I am nearly never disappointed! DON'T GO THERE.
The atmosphere is great. they serve you a cheap prosecco on the house. I could not drink it. Then you get the bottle home, a good detail, useless if the wine is poor. Service (the lady in the right was poor. Nervous, speedy, rushing. If we needed service, they suddenly would not hear. They pushed the tasting menus. We did not go for that. Tension when speaking to them. Tension between them (you might see it from the picture. The last thing you wanton holiday. Not a good tip from TripAdvisor"
Negative,0,"Last Dinner in Rome. What a terrible choice.We were in Rome for a few days for the wedding of our friends, and we booked for Ad Hoc because of my love for truffles. I thought it would be the best way to end the trip - I was wrong.

Cooking with truffles is not the same as sticking some truffle shavings on a dish. This restaurant believes on the later. Besides this (huge) issue, the service was slow, borderline rude and generally not in line with the prices of the menus.

The food itself was nothing more than average - every other meal we had in Rome was better - and I deeply regret visiting and above all convincing two of our friends to join us.

Food quality and service are a huge mismatch with the price. Would not visit again."
Negative,0,"DisappointingOur baseline for comparing ""fine dining"" restaurants while traveling is what we are used to in San Francisco where what we consider ""excellent"" would include the Slanted Door, Foreign Cinema, etc.
By that standard, Ad Hoc was a major disappointment.

Having enjoyed at Ciampini (above the Spanish Steps), on a previous evening, what was hands down the best duck breast I have ever had, I was looking for something at least as close in quality. So I tried duck breast at Ad Hoc and found it tough and pretty much tasteless (other than a truffle adornment). My spouse had veal stuffed rabbit which was mostly veal (dry ground meat) and little rabbit. 

Pasta with truffles and a sampler antipasti were good. But the main courses were just so sub par.

The wine selection was varied but I found the prices (at least of those wines with which I am familiar) to be high (even compared to other restaurants). There was no real sommelier and the waitress, despite knowing something about the wines they serve, had no knowledge of world wines like the California Pinot Noirs we were hoping to find a like offering for.

A well behaved toddler at an adjacent table eventually started to lose interest in remaining well behaved (as is reasonably expected) and that detracted as much from the fine dining experience as did the seating of male guests in shorts.  

Rounding out my unhappiness with Ad Hoc was the ""air conditioned"" temperature of 28 degrees Celsius, which is well into the high 80s F. It was almost as hot inside the restaurant as it was outside on a summer July evening in Rome.

We won't be going back."
Negative,0,"DisappointedIt's our last night in Rome, found this highly rated restaurant from trip adviser, had high expectation for the last fine dining in Rome. The Gaja wine was excellent, the tasting starter plate was great, however, everything else was disappointing. Most dishes were too salty, not well presented as a top rate restaurant should be. I wonder how it gets such great reviews on trip adviser... Maybe the excellent rating raised our expectation so it's hard to exceed! I almost doubt if it's the same chef tonight that prepare dishes for us!"
Negative,0,"Slow, slow, slow....This was our 3rd visit to Ad Hoc - and it will be the last one too.

We had booked a table at 8.00 p.m. a month in advance and requested a table in the room to the left without any comments from Ad Hoc. However on arrival we were shown to a table in the room to the right. When we denied we were then shown to a table in the room to the left.

However this was only the beginning of our troubles. We were seated, offered a glass of spumante - very nice - and had the menu. Then for more than 20 minutes nothing happened. Then our orders were taken.

I ordered the fish tasting menu and my husband the land tasting menu. Both with pairing wine menu.

Then we had an amuse and now we started waiting again. At appr. 9.00 our starters were served and at appr. 10.00 our pastas were served. 
My pasta was not hot, only lukewarm. When I mentioned it to the waitress she said ""she would tell the chef"". 
Also I found out that for the fish menu the 3 starters and the 2 pastas both included smoked salmon and octopus/squid - not very varied.

At 10.30 e.g. 2 ½ hour after our arrival there were still no sign of the main courses. I then asked when we could expect these and were told that these long waiting hours was normal and that customers normally liked this. and that many customers actually booked tables at 18.00 or 19.00 p.m. to go home before 11.00 p.m.

I then asked for the bill - otherwise we could have stayed until midnight.

Payed 70 EUR for to starters, to pastas and four glasses of wine and the ""free"" spumante.

The other 2 times we had been very satisfied but after this time we will NEVER return."
Negative,0,"Great ambience but the food quality ???Ad Hoc restaurant had a top 60 rating in Rome and our family did have some expectations of well cooked food and good service this evening.  30 minutes before we where invited to a complimentary truffle tasting in the restaurants truffle store. This was a very nice startup for the dinner and maybe our expectations increased a bit more after this.
We got a glass of complimentary sparkling wine upon arriving and soon after a small teaser of cheese-mousse which was great.
We had scallops and tartare for starters. The scallops where well over done but the beef tartar was fresh and good. As main course we had the sucking pig that was again well over done and dry, also it had very little taste, it came with light fried and crispy artichoke that tasted good. We also had ox cheek that was a bit to well done.
Im happy we didn't go for the truffle dishes on the menu (same dishes but double price and truffle). With a good bottle of Tignanello (95€) the meal was 253€. For that I would expect a lot better quality from the kitchen! 
The ambience is very nice and service good so its really sad that the kitchen didn't deliver.
Ofcourse I didnt expect michelin star class but this experience was just not okej, this is what you could expect from the cheapest osteria anywhere. I would not go there again."
Negative,0,"Do not bother.While the wine was excellent and the atmosphere nice the food was neither. In fact, it was actually bad. This restaurant is a definite no go!"
Negative,0,"Lack of serviceBooked six weeks ago by my girlfriend as her parents had highly recommended it and was so excited about the taster menu. Confirmed again several weeks ago. Dressed for a nice occasion to mark the end of our holiday, arrived by taxi and the lights were out. Note on the door saying closed for planned refurbishment. Not hard to send an email informing us as it was a pain to find another restaurant serving the same quality of food at no notice. Real shame as the reviews are so good for this place, not great service for potential customers this time though."
Negative,0,"Worst dining experience of my life!****** DO NOT GO*******
I don't think I have ever been made to feel quite so invisible, unwanted and worthless in my life.
Can hardly find the words to describe just how terrible the service was at this restaurant.
Basically ignored by wait staff, left waiting, sneered at.
Ad Hoc there is no way that you deserve the position you have as one of Rome's top restaurants.
Absolutely appalling.
My experience was exactly the same as all the other ""terrible"" reviews. How a business can still be running with such a consistent level of poor customer service is beyond me!

*********VILE***********"
Negative,0,"Great staff, terrible foodThe only reason I'm giving it a poor and not terrible is because the staff is wonderful, attentive, knowledgeable and lovely. The food is just not good. We went on our honeymoon and did the truffle tasting. Every course was dry, overcooked, under seasoned and sometimes plain inedible. I couldn't even cut the duck with my knife. The ""tiramisu"" in the dessert tasting was whipped cream over coffee grounds. And the ""creme brûlée"" was about a teaspoon of pudding under such an absurdly thick layer of uncooked suger. Just really not good. 

It's not cheap, 150 euro per person for the mixed truffle tasting with wine. Just really really disappointing. We don't complain at restaurants so we grinned and bared it but for that much money we're pretty damn pissed. 

The place is beautiful, and again staff is lovely. But the food was just terrible. And to be honest, it seems like a bit of a racket. You're paying for truffles and there was very little on each dish. So besides the dishes being poorly cooked, they didn't have much truffle on them. 

I feel bad even writing this review. We work in restaurants and I hate crapping on other chefs. But this was just too much. If the restaurant sees this, please note that your staff is excellent. At least there's that."
Negative,0,"Stay away of itWe recently reserved for a family event and when we showed a rude girl at the door simply said they had given the table to other customers. We were 10' late (caught in the usual Roman traffic) but they didn't even think of calling us (why do they ask for the phone number?), just acted in the worst and least professional way. Happily the evening turned into a good one as we found a much better spot around there!"
Negative,0,"DissapointingAmbience is great, wine list very good.

Tasting menu was a selection of poor canapes, the ones that you have at really bad wedding receptions. Pig in a blanket type of bites.

Staff was ok but my server was not english or italian speaking....We didnt know what we were eating

I was shocked at the reviews I read....for 100 euro a person.....you expect something decent......how you can fail at pasta in Rome?"
Negative,0,"Not that kind of feelingAs we book by internet, and have the reply from them that there will be an event for tasting of truffle, just besides the main shop. I think that is quite a good starting and warm welcome. However, while arrive, the waiter told us it is another stall, not belong to them. We are told to walk 50 metres, however, there are a lot other restaurants nearby. And the worst is, it is raining. I just think they should lead me there, but in vain.

Food is okay, average. Wine was suggested to be the one next to me, just wonder if it is convenient for taking out, ha..."
Negative,0,"Overpriced for subpar foodI saw the amazing reviews on TA so decided to book it for our first night in Rome.  To our dismay the food was terrible for my husband and average for me.  My husband likes lean beef and the waiter assured us it is lean meat.  It was so fatty he couldn't eat any of it. 
I ordered fish which was OK.  The meal was expensive and not impressive. 
Very disappointed.  Would Not recommend."
Negative,0,"Bad service and mediocre foodBad service, literally had to flag down the waiter multiple times to get another glass of wine. Serving champagne in a wine glass is also odd for such a ""nice restaurant"". My fiancé and I both ordered the 5 course degestution. By the time we got to the 3rd course I asked for the check. I didn't want to waste anymore time in this place nor eat the bland food that looked as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp. There are much better options in Rome."
Negative,0,Food in perfection but lack of service!Ristorante AdHoc in Rome brings out the best from the kitchen but with 2 few serving the rating goes down rapidly! I have never ever got the two first courses that fast but after that nothing..... We could not even order an espresso because the staff had to much work to do. This was our wedding dinner!!!
Negative,0,"Not worth your money!We had read great reviews of Ad Hoc and I therefore booked a table long time in advance - as we were going to celebrate my mothers birthday. We had read that the restaurant had a dress code - so we dressed up. We visited the truffle tasting room - which was a pleasant experience with bubbles and truffles. The staff was also very Nice and professionell here. However, when we arrived at the restaurant we were greeted by a rather rude waiter!! And the restaurant did not seem to have a dress code at all - as there were guests in jeans, jeans jackets, shorts and also jogging suits?!! We ordered the land tasting meny with wine. The first course was rather ok and so was the pasta. The main course was not ok - it did not taste anything. I had also asked in advance if they could have a surprice for my mother - but the only thing she got was a candle on her dessert (which we had ordered already). The waiter continued to be rude out through the evening!! I would not recommend this restaurant!"
Negative,0,"Beyond Disappointing!I recently arrived about five minutes early for a 9:30pm dinner reservation on a Saturday evening.  I had planned on doing the tasting menu as it was the last evening of my holiday.  The reviews on Trip Advisor were relatively positive, so this helped to drive my dining decision for that evening.

Upon arrival at the restaurant, there was no host or hostess at the door to greet customers.  I understand that service is quite lacking in Italy and not up to American standards, but a simple greeting is not much to expect.  I observed two rather haggard looking servers who were running around like chickens with their heads cut off as the restaurant was pretty full.

My guest and I were finally greeted by one of the servers who was a bit snarly.  She sat us at our table, which faced both the front door and the service station, so it really wasn't the best seat in the house.  I was disappointed, but there really was not anything that we could do about it.

We were presented with menus after about a 5 minute wait and then our server disappeared to assist with other tables.  After about 15 minutes, she came over and took our order, including our wine order.  But then disappeared.  Each time that we tried to flag her down, she just rolled her eyes at us and ran to assist the other server or other tables.

After another 10 minutes, she came back and informed us that the wine that we had ordered was no longer available.  I then proceeded to select another wine.  She then returned to the table 10 minutes later with the new bottle.  The appalling part is that she simply slammed the bottle down on the table and then ran off to assist another table without opening our wine.  I'm really not sure why, but her behavior was unprofessional and downright insulting.  

So now after 40 minutes of sitting at the table, we still had no wine or food.  This was probably some of the sloppiest and rudest service that I have ever experienced. This is not the way that we envisioned our last meal in Rome.  My guest and I ultimately decided to leave and find a restaurant that appreciated our business.  As such, we simply got up and left.  The funny part is that neither server even noticed that we were leaving or had left as they were too busy with other tables. 

Hopefully, if you're seeking out a fine dining experience, which should include superior service in addition to good food, I would suggest looking elsewhere.

You've been duly warned!"
Negative,0,"Left UnnoticedWe specifically went to this place after reading all the wonderful reviews here. It started out wonderfully with a truffle tasting in a private room with sparking wine. Unfortunately, what started out as an experience ended with us cutting off the meal early. 

We are a party of four and were the third table seated at our 6:30 reservation. We ordered a bottle of wine and appetizers. We had the pumpkin blossoms, the seafood sampler, and the cheese tasting. Everything was mediocre at best, but presented very nicely. Once the appetizer was cleared we finished our bottle of wine and had to wait 45 minutes before our pasta was brought to the table. Again this was mediocre at best, but displayed very nicely. 

The wait staff never came by to fill up water or ask we if wanted another bottle of wine. Finally they cleared the pasta and we set in to wait for our second course. A rabbit stuffed with spiced veal. Needless to say we never made it that far. At 9pm we had to get up and track the manager down, whom never once came over to check on us, and tell her we were done. 

The consolation was sending the head waitress over to offer a sparkling wine. For all the hype and the price you're paying, this was absolutely unacceptable and unenjoyable. We were very disappointed after all the high reviews here on trip advisor. 

Beware as the entire audience was foreigners and there was never a wait. A restaurant rated this highly should be reservation only."
Negative,0,"Disappointed in TA - led me astrayProbably the most disappointed I've been in a restaurant strongly recommended by trip advisor! My two selections for a main course - rabbit and fish of the day were adequate - however portions were minimalist and rabbit was ground!My daughter's filet strips were, I believe, also ground and past due date! I know about aged beef, as my father raised angus, this had been hung WAY too long! Asked that my daughter's be taken back, which was done, but found it added to bill! Thankfully, upon my objection they removed it! I would never return to this restaurant and felt that I was mislead by trip advisor whom I continually proclaim to be priceline's arch rival! Maybe not so! I hope to not be disappointed again, as I may have to drop my allegiance to TA, as well as, my stock!"
Negative,0,"Would NOT recommendMy boyfriend and I visited the Ad Hoc restaurant on the second of our two night stay in Rome. We had read fantastic reviews and were really keen to go, we actually tired to book on our first evening to no avail, as it was fully booked. Having secured a table for our last night we were looking forward to a fantastic meal. We arrived and were greeted by a friendly-ish blonde lady (in a rather short skirt!) and were shown to our table. We were seated for at least 5 minutes, if not more, before anyone came over to offer us a menu/drink etc but were willing to overlook this because of the fantastic reputation. We finally had sight of a menu, not before being told that the prawns and cod were unavailable for the evening. We placed our order and thought all was well, until the waitress came over to confirm what my boyfriend had ordered because in her words she was 'confused': not something you expect when paying the prices they ask for. We were then served an apperetife by a different waitress and shown the wine list (finally!). The apperetife was lovely and we decided to order a bottle of Riesling wine to go with out food - not before having been told that they 'might not have it', due to a busy night the night before. Again, not what you would expect when paying through the nose for a gastronomic experience. After a long wait, our main courses finally arrived, although, sadly, all I could taste was an unhealthy level of salt over the main dish and the sides. We mentioned to the waitress after finishing our main courses that this was the case and she acknowledged this (having not checked our food and asked if we were ok the whole way through the meal). We were then left at our table for a fairly solid amount of time, during which we witnessed what was frankly a shocking display between two members of staff (curiously, both the staff members who had served us) engaging in a full blown argument which included raising voices in front of guests, slamming plates and menus and even resulted in the manager becoming involved. As an aside - the table next to us had ordered the taster menu and when their food arrived the waitress (the same one serving us) had to question the food she was serving them as she couldn't remember what it was and then proceeded to swap the plates round twice because she could not remember who had ordered what. We were then asked whether we would like a desert, to which we replied no and asked for the bill. We were then asked to come over to the window tables because the card machine would not work where we were sitting. Upon delivery of our bill, we were also issued with a feedback form, on which we commented that the food had been average and certainly not what you would expect for the price and the service had been terrible. The only saving grace of the evening was the bottle of sparkling wine which every female guest was given upon departure. We are a young couple in our mid twenties and are lucky enough to have eaten in some of the worlds best restaurants, we are not overly fussy but the service we received at Ad Hoc was absolutely disgraceful in terms of the way the staff were behaving in front of paying customers and we would absolutely not recommend this restaurant to anyone, we were offered no discount and the meal cost us €130. I urge you to think twice before you consider going for a meal here, not cheap and disappointingly average food but we could have overlooked this had the service been exceptional, which it certainly was not."
Negative,0,"Most expensive pasta dish ever!!!I went to this place to celebrate my birthday and had a big disappointment. I ordered the truffled gnocchi that cost 25 euros and the waitress said:_black or white truffle? So I said white, I don't even know why. The food was OK and when the bill came they charged me 45 euros for my plate!!! So when I complained they told me in front of everyone that I should know the white truffle is much more expensive that the others, even though the price wasn't anywhere. You can imagine the humiliation. I think any restaurant should know you don't offer something that will double the price of the dish without warning the costumer, only if you have bad intentions of over-charging it. Thank God for trip advisor and the power we have of telling our story so the same won't happen to other travellers."
Negative,0,"Not good at allIt is a mystery to us where all these excellent reviews come from, because this is for sure not one of the best restaurants in rome. It is definitely nothing special, with things on their card that are not in season, and fish i.e. tuna being served that is past its date. We would for sure not go back and not really recommend this restaurant either. Also the service was not great, the waitresses were friendly but slow."
Negative,0,"WannabeIt's as though the chef has watched a few too many reality tv cooking shows and thinks he can replicate. Unfortunately, the quality falls far short of Gordon Ramsey! 

Decent wine selection, but the food is not very good at all... A fancy swoosh of some colourful yet indiscernible liquid does not elevate the meal to 'fine dining'!!"
Negative,0,"deceptive,crooks and rude managerthe waitress said that the dish contained cherry tomato juice and not cherry tomatoes as stated in the menu.She said that they would put cherry tomatoes at no extra cost .subsequently she forgot about me and proceeded to argue with me about what she said.
the manager did not help and could not care . These are horrible people to give your money . please go to other restaurants where there are less crooks. horrible,horrible,horrible people,especially the manager!"
Negative,0,"Average at bestLet me start by saying that I don't eat to live but live to eat! I chose this restaurant based on the raving reviews.  Well what a dissapointment. It was not a disaster but is was below average. The restaurant does have a very nice decor and ambience, nice jazzy lounge music (the same cd played in loop all evening, hearing the songs 3 times). The young attractive hostesses were nice but do not know anything about food or wine.
 We chose the Sea tasting menu with wine pairing. Instead of pouring the wine at the table, they bring you your glass and tell you what it is. The first wine, supposedly a Chardonay was terrible so I asked to see the bottle. They brought me a bottle that was not open and told me that was the wine. I asked if they could bring us the bottles from there on, they did not. I asked to swith the Rose wine with a Red to go with the pasta, which they did, but it was just the wrong type of red for this, maybe my faut. A couple of the dish we had were good, lobster pasta and the baby squid. The rest was ok or below average. I had asked to switch the creme brule deserts with the other two, which agreed and aknowledged but they brought us the creme brules anyway. 
 Everything about this restaurant is like presuming to be something they are not, everything is superficial. No reputable restaurant gives 10% off for booking online and thta alone should have been my flag. I have a hard time understanding how people can write that this is the best restaurant they have eaten in in their life. We spent 12 days in Italy ad this was by far our worst experience in Rome,I was more angry at wasting my time than the money!  Try Il Gabriello, that wowed us, try the seefood ravioli and the seafood pasta."
Negative,0,"Worst dining experience everWe were looking forward to this restaurant, but it turned out to be a total disaster. We had to wait at least 40 minutes between each course, and the food was terrible. Only the buffalo cheese in the starter was Ok, everything else from our tasting menu was horrible. Both the taste and texture was the worst I have ever experienced in a restaurant. Service was Ok, but very slow, we had to wait for 10 minutes for water, and 20 minutes for the bill, they seem to ignore the first time you asked, and only acts on the second time. We find everyone dined there speaks English, which is not a good sign for a restaurant in Rome. Two tasting menu plus wines and a stater cost 155 euro, spend your money elsewhere and you can get much better food for 50 euro for 2 people."
Negative,0,"Everything about this place was disappointing.We were really looking forward to our meal here, and had made reservations by email online before we even got to Rome for the weekend. 

I don't usually take time to write negative reviews but really felt that I had to in this instance. 

The decor of the restaurant was very nice, but I'm afraid that's as far as compliments for this place stretch. 

The waitresses were very immature and didn't seem to know anything about the menu. Either that or they just couldn't be bothered to explain anything to us. We placed our order and were not served our starter for 45 mins. It then took ANOTHER HOUR (I kid you not) to be served our mains. 

I ordered the smoked salmon pasta which was hard and actually inedible. I picked out the salmon and just sent it back without asking for a replacement, or refund before you ask. The whole dish was just a disaster. Quite frankly, my 7 year old can cook a better pasta dish than that which was served to me that evening. The pasta course alone was £15. 

The started, I can't remember what it was meant to be but it was heavy and greasy- possibly courgette flowers, I don't recall. 

I ordered the 2-spilt mains and chose the catch of the day and tuna. They were both terrible. Really, I might as well have been in Bella Italia in Croydon for the quality of the food. 

By the time we finished our first three courses it was nearly 11.30pm. By this point we were so tired and irritated by the poor service and poor food that we decided not to stay for dessert. Possibly the best decision I made during my weekend in Rome. 

£115 for 3 courses, not inc dessert or wine. 

Less bothered am I about the £115 that I won't get back as the 2 and a half hours of my life spent dining there that could have been spent enjoying a meal elsewhere."
Negative,0,What a jokeWe had holiday and we were eating in different good restaurants in rome. Visit in ad hoc was totally under our expections. We waited for long time all the time and service had huge problems. Whit food they just tried to do it way too complicated (less is more). Truffes ok everything else more or less horrible.
Negative,0,"Ad Hoc...Ad Nauseam!We chose this restaurant because Trip Advisor ranked it among the top (#8 of 5922) restaurants in Rome, Italy. 

On our first attempt, we were told that because we had no reservations we could not dine there that night. The following day we made the reservation and we got a table for two. The restaurant was not busy that night. The space was ample where we were seated so I re-arranged my seat in order that I will be seated next to my wife and not across from her as we had always done in other restaurants. One of the hostesses approached us and told me that I should not move my chair from the original arrangement and did not elaborate further. I was quite surprised because we had never experienced this policy and besides they did not offer to seat us together in another table, as there were many empty tables that night. Because of this event, we were made to feel as “unwanted” patrons.

It took another 20-30 minutes before we were asked about our orders. We also had to request for a wine list as we were not provided a list with the menu. When we asked we were told by the server, “Oh, you want a glass of wine?” “What kind? We again asked that we please be provided with the wine list.

We ordered: a bottle of red wine; “ad hoc” pumpkin flowers for starters; flat spaghetti with baby squid for our pasta; and sea bass fillet, for our main course. Except for the “ad hoc”pumpkin flowers, which were quite good, the rest of the food were not out of the ordinary and quite saltier than what we would have preferred. Furthermore, throughout our dinner, we had to repeatedly request for attendance to our dining needs including extra  utensils, water, and even pepper.

The ambiance of this place was replete with the plasticity of protocol demonstrated by the entire staff which detracted from the “Italian warm hospitality” we expected. We felt that we and others just trying to have a good culinary experience should not be treated this way. At the “Ad Hoc, we had an “Ad Nauseam”Experience."
Negative,0,"The most fundamental of cooking mistakes!!!I have to say that I had great expectations from this restaurant. I am always disappointed from the offer of estaurant in Rome: tradiational ones are boring, most expensive one often disappointing (a part from Il Pagliaccio, but it is ineed expensive). The worst restaurant in the world is in Rome (Convivio Troiani...). So, an acceptably priced, good level restaurant is sorely missed. Well, Ad hoc did not fill the gap. I had the gastronomy menu, to try their best effort. With wines... Lets start with the good things: some starters were good (courgette flowers, tartare's...) and the wines offered with the menu are really good. Than, the sore point: salt and some average cooking in the pasta and main dishes. Come on, the spaghetti in the parmigiano nest are trivial from one side, and a concentrate of salt from the other. A lot of the dishes were far too salty. The mains were not exciting, nothing really to lift them from a honest average. Not what I was looking for. Just a bad night? No sure....."
Negative,0,"A must missThis was supposed to be our big splurge in Rome. 
We were looking forward to our meal at Ad Hoc with great enthusiasm, and when I told my wife they had a Truffles tasting menu, her eyes glazed over. 
When we arrived, we were seated directly across from where the servers picked up their food orders, even though the restaurant was nowhere near full. They then moved us to a table that was perhaps 12"" further removed from the food station.
They later moved us to another room that had only two other tables occupied at the time. Why they did not seat us there from the outset, I have no logical answer.
After looking over the menu, 
we ordered a bottle of red wine from Sicily. When I asked to have it decanted to help it breathe, the server said decanting was unnecessary,
and was steadfast in refusing my request. This was a first for any place I have ever at.
When we we served our entrees, the side dish of risotto and truffles was cold. Midway through the entree, the server came back to ask how the meal was, and I commented that ""the beef was good."" And though it was plainly evident that there was only a forkful sampled from the risotto, the server never bothered to make an inquiry.
Though I have an almost insatiable sweet tooth, we did not even look at the dessert menu.
At that point, we wanted to leave as quickly as possible,
but that was a challenge as well. After waiting 20 minutes for the check, I got up from the table to ask a different server for our check.
I waited a week before writing about this experience, hoping that time would lessen its sting.
It has not.
If however, you are looking for an expensive meal where the attitude is that diners should feel fortunate that they have been allowed to spend a copious amount for a meal, then Ad Hoc in Rome may be your kind of place."
Negative,0,"Terrible, arrogant service!Our family was anticipating a wonderdul dinner on our final night in Rome. Despite a reservation made and confirmed by our hotel, on May 25, 2013, we were rudely turned away at the door and told our reservation did not exist!  I even showed the hostess the e-mail from the hotel confirming our reservation, but she kept us waiting for 10 minutes while she ""checked"" the e-mail address of the hotel.  No apologies, no attempt to seat us despite many empty tables at the time.  We were told they were booked for the next 10 days and to return....really?our vacation is over tomorrow."
Negative,0,"Not thrilled to be an outlier, but here is why we didn't like the restaurantI am going to start this review by saying that I can not blame the restaurant completely.  We showed up  late for our already late reservation, and I think that the staff was not thrilled that we had shown up in the first place. But the situation quickly devolved from there.

My biggest negative  about the place may have been the mistranslations of the menu.  We were given English menus with Italian, which I can't argue against, but the translations were so bad that what we ordered and what we received were more than a little different.  For example, my older son ordered a beef filet.  What arrived was ground veal cheek with raisins and pine nuts. Which is what the Italian menu says it is.  They were nice about it and refunded our money,  but, for a place that clearly was full of British tourists, it seemed to be a major mistake.  An English menu item for suckling pig ended up being a rolled sausage of some form.  Since many of the reviewers had either a tasting menu or truffle pasta they may not have noted this but if you go ala carte its important. 

My wife had ordered the truffle pasta.  This was fine, but she originally received another pasta.  They did correct this error.  

Regardless of the menu descriptions, many of the dishes suffered from the ""one ingredient too many syndrome.""  

Other negatives may have been more temporary.  The restaurant was stuffy and hot.  Although our server was nice, the woman who appeared to be functioning as the head server was not.  I don't think she saw me watching her as she made a ""tongue out of the mouth"" face while gesturing with her eyes at our table.  Nice.

I do know that we our outliers in terms of what we think about this place and I do know that we were not completely innocent guests as we were 25' late for our table.  But I can not remember a less pleasant overall dinner experience in quite some time."
Negative,0,"over-rated by tourists, not locals.I booked through my hotel who told me that it was hard to get a table as they were always full, but managed to get a table last night. 

The first, terrible impression were that the wines were over priced : the bottle I wanted they were charging 50 percent more than the restaurant (near the colosseum) I went to the previous night. Secondly there were no locals eating there - another warning sign.

Then they brought the grissini which were soft when I bit into them, and the bread was stale. After the first course which was dismal we cancelled the rest of the courses and left. It was nice of them to take the food items we had half-eaten off the bill and only charge for the over-priced wine we had ordered. As for the atmosphere it is very dark inside and has a very touristy feel to it. 

To conclude, judging from the prices in comFranceon to other establishments, this place is a tourist trap, as it is on Via Ripetta which is off Via del Corso the main street in Rome which is crowded with tourists."
Negative,0,"Nice people, okay foodNot sure why this restaurant is so well reviewed here. Service is friendly, and they do give you a free bottle of sparkling wine when you leave, but the food is busy and not especially remarkable. While we were there, a table of three cancelled their main courses and left after the appetizer course. I would have done the same."
Negative,0,"DisappointingThe restaurant looks lovely, very romantic, low lighting, staff very smart.  However - The Emporer's New Clothes comes to mind.  It took ages to get our order in, the starters arrived before the wine.  Three of us ordered the same main meal - roasted beef.  Oh dear!  Under seasoned and actually not very nice at all.  We didn't eat it.  We ordered some vegetables which arrived aout 20 minutes after we had finished eating so we didn't eat those either.  We asked for the bill and it took 35 minutes to arrive.  To their credit they did remove the three uneaten main meals from the bill which made things a bit better but as the meal was meant to be a very special 50th birthday celebration, it was a huge disappointment.  We would not return."
Negative,0,"if you dont drink wine DONT gosaw ad hoc in first place on the site so i thought it was good so i went there even though the concierge warned me that it was not up to the hype.. he was unfortunately right...

pro's
1\ the waiter was very nice and polite.
2\ got a 2 FREE complementary bottels of Champagne even though i said i do not drink 
3\ got a 10% discount on the items from there shop 

con's
1\ very small and hard to get to your chair.
2\ was told there is a 3 week waiting list ( booked on the same day and took the best table)
3\ the experience takes at least 2 and half hours. (very slow service)
4\ the food was terrible, me and my wife could not finish any of the 9 dishes that was presented to us.

maybe because i dont drink, or i was ""over-hyped"" by the rating and expecting to taste some thing from out of this world, i did not like any thing about it, and i will never recommend it to any one i love.

i think the high ratings that AD Hoc gets is because of the free Champagne and the discount."
Negative,0,"Terrible ExperienceI couldn't understand how this restaurant became the first one in Rome. I had many better experiences compared to this average restaurant. The food was definitely over rated. Even if I exclude the meal, the service was extremely slow. We've waited for 1 hour 45 min for our main course to arrive. They could only bring the check after 45 more minutes. And we could leave the restaurant waiting for 3 hours in total spending only half an hour to eat. On top of all that, there were few clients due to season and many waitresses. Total disaster..."
Negative,0,"Who the hell is writing the reviews?????I cannot believe the reviews. We went to this restaurant after all the glowing reviews. I have visited Rome maybe 30 times. I was astonished by the bad service and average food. We arrived at 8 pm and there was no one around to greet.... Wandered around the restaurant and finally some one came. We sat down and were given our menues and wine list.
For 20 mins we sat  and perused the menu. All good ,another 20 we sat and waited to be served . Finally an order is placed. We recieved our food. My ragu.. Well it was more stirfry. Beef strips than any ragu I have ever eaten.
The rest of the meal followed suit. Wine was slow to come out etc. I can tell you that for a 8 pm booking we had only recieved mains at 10.30 pm.  While our plates were cleared by 9.20. More than 1 hour to get our mains is little long. We  only ordered entree and mains thank god.
We witnessed the table next to us forgo the complimentary amuse bouche. Which was placed on her plate. Then picked up and offered by the waitstaff to the next table . We could not leave quick enough. 
I generally don't quibble with rankings but this is not a restaurant worthy of 1. 
If the food is executed well but not to my taste I have no issue. Thats my problem . Not the restaurant .
Sadly this was not the case. The food was very average and overpriced . Remarkably we paid a similar price for our Michelin starred dinner in Capri only a few days before hand. Go figure"
Negative,0,"Average food, terrible service - OVERATEDWe were more than excited to be visiting the ""second best restaurant in Rome"" only to be majorly dissapointed by rushed and rude service, and food which was very mediocre. I have eaten in many resturants in Italy and I need two hands to count the amount of places I have eaten which are better than this. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING."
Negative,0,"I don't get it...How this is ranked the #1/#2 restaurant in Rome I will never understand.  Everything is just okay. The food, the decor, the service. All just okay.  In a city like Rome, with so many authentic, amazing dining options, it would never cross my mind to eat here again."
Negative,0,"A giant let down!We saved, what we thought was going to be ""the best for last"" meal in Rome at Ad Hoc. Based on the number of outstanding reviews; wow, were we disappointed! The atmosphere is great, the service decent, but the food was less than mediocre, it was bad. We enjoyed so many wonderful meals on this trip; La Pergola, Trattoria Monti, Piperno; to name a few. All were delicious! We assumed it wasn't possible to have a sub par meal in Rome until Ad Hoc. The crudo course had no flavor; the prawn and oyster were actually gross. The pasta was over salted and luke warm, the truffle starters were mushy; lacking both texture and flavor. My lobster pasta was over cooked as well and I gave up half way through, when it started to feel like dutiful and not enjoyable eating. The desert was good... A tiramisu that tasted like the edible embodiment of a cappuccino.
My boyfriend doesn't drink, so no complimentary bottle of bubbly was offered to us. Personally, I like a good glass of wine, but food is most important in a place like this... or at least it should have been."
Negative,0,"Very averageLovely setting, great service and great service but the food (which is the whole point!) is very average. Lacking taste and a waste of money... would not return. Had equal food in side street cafe / restaurant for a quarter of the price!! They ran out of desert I ordered but without asking changed for something totally different without even asking... not great"
Negative,0,"Food was average, Service was a Let DownService staff couldn't even be bothered to tell us the welcome drink was complimentary, so we opted out only to hear them telling the French family behind 10mins later. 
We had the black truffle tasting menu. Absolutely no interest in smiling or asking how the food is, several courses nearly dropping the plate while laying it down. Portions were too big but still of acceptable standard until we reached dessert. 
We waited 25mins for the Crème Brûlée  and when we reminded the service staff, she very rudely replied, ""It's coming, okay?!"" When it came, it was only half done, with so much unmelted sugar still on top! 
Another 20mins spent just waiting for them to tally up the bill which had no breakdown. Atrotious"
Negative,0,"How can this be rated the #1 in RomeMy wife having seen this as the highest rated place in Rome convinced me to try it. I must give those that are not familiar with my BLOG ""The PhotoGourmet"" a little background, I'm a well traveled FOODIE. We have been to Rome over a hundred times. I don't consider Rome a fine dining destination it has great local food. AD HOC was extremely disappointing !! We were looking at each other wondering if the Chef had died and been replaced by a dishwasher. I returned my first course because it some burnt calamari that was presented cold. The very nice server did replaced it with a fish carpaccio that was served warm enough that it was probably spoiled. Each course that followed was equally poor...we hardly ate anything. We gave up got a bill and left very disappointed. We had the Seafood and Truffle tasting menus the bill came to 170 EURO which we would have been glad to pay if it was enjoyable!  The only saving grace was the nice server and some nice wines."
Negative,0,Too salty...Food...even the bread... was way too salty...and I am a salt person.  my husband and I couldn't even finish.  the restaunt is too hot.  the waitress didn't bring the check for 30 minutes after being asked three times!  I am really surprised this is number one.
Negative,0,"Average at bestI reserved a table at Ad Hoc for my boyfriend's birthday dinner while we were in Rome. Booking via the website was very simple and if you still want to go despite my review I'd encourage you to do the same well in advance, as the restaurant was completely full when we were there on a weeknight. 
When I say full I mean that it was full of tourists like ourselves. So the ambience was very nice, but it was hardly authentic. There was one table of Italian speakers (who also seemed like tourists) that walked in as we waited for our desert.
Waiting was a big theme throughout the evening. We both ordered the Roman-style tasting menu and waited about 15-20 minutes between each of the 4 courses. 
The wine pairings were very disappointing and a couple of them were just bad. They only served wines from Lazio - three heavy reds, and a desert wine (which was undrinkable). The servers recited juts the names and didn't seem at all knowledgable about the wines. 
The food itself wasn't great either though it came in wide variety. Only one of three starters and one of three first courses were really good. Neither of the two main courses were edible as thy were too salty and overcooked. I also overheard the guy at the next table who ordered the same tasting menu Say the same thing to the server as he returned his plate. The desert was fine.
Overall, not exceptional and not recommended. I'd say average, but for the price (80 euro per person) I expected more."
Negative,0,"Bad hoc'dUpon entering, thought we scored with a great atmosphere and pleasant staff. Had a fabulous beef carpaccio appetizer and a skeevishly warm seafood tartar appetizer. Our beef truffle entre was cold, dry, and clearly reheated. The suckling pig was more like pork jerky. The stuffed rabbit was not what was expected and had two large pieces of solid fat in it. It was much like a rabbit meat loaf. The wine list was great but we do not recommend wasting your money and time at Ad Hoc"
Negative,0,"A big disappointment to food lover!!Go Ad Hoc if you don't mind articifical service and tourist style truffles menu.

I did lot of research before all trips for food and TripAdvisor is one good source.  I seldom picked the top 10 restaurants as it was rated high mostly because of the no of visits are highest, and the restaurant is likely a commercialized tourist place.   This time I made a big mistake to choose Ad Hoc because it is just 3 min walk from our Boutique hotel and convenient for dinner.

It was a total waste of time and money.   Food quality was much below average especially if you consider the price.   Bread was cold and nothing special.   All truffle dishes tasted alike, salty and could not match well with the pasta or meat.  Carbonara was disaster.  My lady girlfriend just touched a bit and left all in the plate.

Service was artificial and slow.  The only good thing was they speak good English while most local Italian restaurant not.   The waiter was cruel in the beginning and started to smile after her manager turned up to greet us.   But you could tell that it was tourist place kind of service.

We visited a small restaurant just around the corner the other day which was much better.   At least the ingredient was fresh and the smile was genuine."
Negative,0,"Experiment was awful.Restaurant - for tourists! That has read on a site, and has seen, these are two different things. Experiment was awful. In salad begun to ruccola which was in a bottom that it haven't noticed, bound together macaroni and unfairly expensive wines. The account comprised any percent and not clear dish. In my opinion it has been obviously overestimated! Italian at this restaurant isn't present anything, as it seemed to me. I think, Italians aren't frequenters of this institution!!!! When I was, saw only tourists and heard only English-speaking speech. I believe in Rome there are enough wonderful places which can be visited, instead of this institution!!!!!"
Negative,0,"Tourist trapI feel ridiculous that we let the reviews of tourists guide us to where to eat good italian food. Besides for good service and wine the food was below average and extremely over priced (80euro pp). The truffle dishes were terribly salty, the shrimps not fresh, we sent them back. The whole night I suffered from heartburn from the plethora of butter in the cooking. In summary, you know the saying, when in Rome... Well here we didn't hear Italian being spoken."
Negative,0,"MAJOR Disappointment...Terrible Service....Average FoodI give the food 3 stars (average) and service 1 star (terrible)...for an overall rating of 2.
My fiance and I dined at Ad Hoc for our last meal of our 14 day Italian vacation. My 3rd trip to Rome. I did a lot of research and spent a lot of time choosing our restaurants for dinner. We were really looking forward to Ad Hoc on our last night in Rome. I now find it hard to believe all of the good reviews on trip advisor.  Before anyone books a reservation, I would urge you to read the less favorable reviews.  You will find 3 consistent themes:  Slow poor service, average food, high prices. 
Based upon the reviews, I expected the service to be extremely slow. It was beyond that...we and the other tables around us went through long periods of at least 30 minutes without ever seeing a waitress. 
A couple of quick notes:
1. The place is beautiful....very nicely decorated and comfortable elegant setting.
2. The food is very average.  I had the cacio e pepe, sea bass, and Italian cheese appetizer....none of the food was that good. My girlfriend had a pasta dish that was good...but not great considering all of the phenomenal food elsewhere on our trip.
3. The service is AWFUL.  We live in Los Angeles and I'm orginally from NY.  We are used to good and poor service in restaurants. I can even excuse poor service if the food is exceptional. That was not the case here. First, we were seated at the same time as 2 other tables with couples and provided menus.  I noticed the other tables were provided with wine lists but we were not. Waitress came by and asked if we wanted still or sparkling water...but no mention of wine.  I decided I would wait to see if she noticed.  30 minutes later she comes by to take our order....no mention of wine. 30 minutes later...appetizers come.  30 minutes later, appetizer plates are cleared. 45 minutes later main course arrives. At this point waitress asked ""Oh I'm sorry...do you want wine?""  I respectfully declined.  
An hour after serving us our main course, they finally clear the plates.  Another 1/2 hour goes by and nobody comes to our table to ask if we wanted dessert or coffee.  Finally, after more than 3 frustrating hours I politlely ask for the check.  After 15 minutes...no check!!!  So I finally get up and track down a waitress and ask again for the check. She responded very coldly...I'm trying to pay my bill!
To be clear....we noticed the same situation occuring with 2 other tables around us.  One couple sitting at the table directly in front of us where clearly unhappy and uncomfortable with the slow service.  They were constantly looking around for a waitress. My fiance noticed a guy dining alone sitting directly behind me.  She felt bad for him because he was seated and then left at the table without anything for 45 minutes before a waitress came to his table. 
This was an overall regrettable experience. This place could be a great restaurant...but with bad service and average food and outrageous prices....there are PLENTY of better options in Rome. Save your money and find other options.  Beautiful place, but not worth it."
Negative,0,"Terrible serviceI reserved a table for 3 about a month before my trip to Rome because of the rave reviews on Tripadvisor. I am sorry to report back with an extremely negative review and I hope that I'm the only one who experienced this:

We arrived on time and was greeted by a lovely waitress and we told them who we were. It took them a rather long time to search for my reservation and seated us at the worst table possible in the entire restaurant - right beside a serving counter where all the dirty dishes were. We were looking at the back the entire night!! This became a major problem when we wanted to ask for the bill and in general got forgotten the whole night. 

1) We were in clear view of all the dirty dishes, the chaos, the drama and the waitress talk - all of which should be kept behind the scenes and not shown to us. 
2) The time difference between us finishing our course and the next course took more than 30 minutes. When we finished a course, the dishes were also cleared about 20-30 minutes later, so we spent most of the time looking at time, trying to get their attention, waiting for them to clear our dishes, while they zoomed in and out of their counter oblivious to our increasing impatience.
3) I honestly felt that they could have given us a better table since I reserved a month to 2 in advance?? 

The service and the waiting made the entire experience really miserable. It was such a nightmare trying to get their attention that we asked for the bill at the same time when we reminded them that we had a dessert that was not yet served. It is a pity that the lack of service has to ruin the chef's effort because the food there is pretty good but without the appropriate staff and amount of manpower, the restaurant just ruins the entire experience. I don't require the staff to smile and be exceptionally friendly, but the waiting and the inattentiveness really bothers me. 

I hope that the management will solve this and perhaps try not to seat anyone near the counter."
Negative,0,"Shocked by the great reviewsI made reservations at Ad Hoc based on the Trip Advisor reviews. I'm assuming we were there on an 'off' night, because it was an awful experience. 

First, they could not find my reservation. I had to go through my emails for 20 minutes before they 'found' our table. 

More importantly, though, the food was disgusting! We literally left most of it on the plates. Mu husband had the ""Land and Sea"" tasting menu and I had the ""Roman Style"" tasting menu, both with wine pairings. I had such high expectations, but the food looked and tasted like over-salted, previously frozen left overs. My meat course was supposed to be Ham Roulades, but all I remember to this day are dried out discs of mystery meat on my plate. 

The best part of the meal was the wine, but the food certainly wasn't worth the effort."
Negative,0,"Our worst dining experience in RomeHaving had some really good food during our stay in Rome some meals costing only a few Euros, we decided to top off our last evening by visiting this restaurant which had good reviews on TA.
It was a memorable evening, unfortunately for all the wrong reasons.
We made a reservation an hour before, although they will have you believe the restaurant is so exclusive you must book a long way ahead. There were empty tables the night we went.
The specialism at this venue is a ""tasting menu"" accompanied by wine with each course at a cost of between 79 euros and 129 euros. We went for this as the individual menu was also very expensive.
Having been at the restaurant over an hour we had only just had our cold starter which although pretty to look at, tasted of nothing.
Almost an hour after that we were served a pasta course which for me was 3 different variations on pasta carbonara. Again nicely presented but almost cold. I would have sent it back but couldnt catch anyones eye. Therfore most of it was left and when the waitress came for the plates I told her I was disappointed in the dish. She said she was sorry I was disappointed.
We had been in the restaurant almost 2 and a half hours before the main course arrived by which time another party of 4 had left before finishing their courses. As only one of them spoke English or Italian they were at somewhat of a disavantage but were clearly unhappy and again there was a bland response to their concerns.
When our main course arrived I again said how disappointed I was with the experience thus far and that as it was now almost 10-30pm my appetite had waned. The lady serving said it wasnt her fault, they were at the mercy of the kitchen and chef so I offered to spaek personally to the chef, manager, owner, whoever was available. My offer was not taken up but several minutes later I was approached by another member of waiting staff who had come to tell me that my choice of desert was no longer available and would I like strudel. I declined and repeated my disappointment with the restaurant overall. She said she was sorry but the problem clearly lay with me as another customer had that evening had the same menu as I and he had enjoyed it and perhaps I lacked appreciation that all the food was freshly cooked. My response was that I could have cooked fresh carbonara in a lot less time than almost 1.5 hours plus and also produced it hot enough to eat.
She seemed keen to engage me in an arguement which I declined and we left soon after having spent 3 hours and over 200 euros for a mediocre meal in a very pretentious atmosphere which showed you dont always get what you pay for. They deducted 19 euros from the bill in consideration of the desert being unavailable.
On the plus side, the wine courses were good, not great but good and my husband said his beef was of the best quality.
In summary if pretentious snobbishness with astronomical prices appeals more than good honest food then this is the place to go but there are far better places in Rome with better food and service at a fraction of these prices."
Negative,0,"Overrated Tourist TrapLiving in Rome for almost five years, we have explored the Roman food scene and have truly found some gems. Over the years though, we have become somewhat complacent with our bubble of comfortable restaurants that we have discovered.

Now about to move from Rome, I got curious and checked trip advisor to see what others had thought of our beloved restaurants. Surprisingly, most of the highest rated restaurants I had never been to. Seeing this, I got ever more curious: perhaps we had missed out on a whole series of incredible restaurants in Rome? We decided to find out.

Ad Hoc was our first challenge to our previous favorites in Rome. Me, my mother, and girlfriend were excited. Rated so highly on trip advisor, I was truly expecting something above and beyond the rest.

The evening started well. We walked in without reservations and were seated promptly directly next to the hostess’s desk where they make reservations. The waitress kindly welcomed us, and everything seemed to be going well. The décor was also deliberate, and designed, unlike most of the humble family restaurants in Rome, where you are likely to see the walls decorated with a mosaic of football memorabilia from Forza Roma and photos of Italian movie actors and actresses from the 50s. This was refreshing for Rome, despite the fact that it definitely felt a little forced. 

The only disconcerting thing (so far) was the fact that there wasn’t an Italian customer in sight. A few English speaking customers surrounded us, and a German family was within sight in the other room.

After being seated, we were all served complimentary prossecco. The bread was notably good also. Not a bad start at all. The menu looked exciting as well. It is uncommon in Rome to find a chef willing to experiment. The menu contained twists on local Roman classics, as well as a list of dishes with truffles used as their main flavor and inspiration. I ordered the “Ad Hoc” gnocchi, my mother ordered the cacio e peppe, and my girlfriend ordered the carbonara three ways. We also tried a few appetizers: Roman style artichokes, fried pumpkin flowers, and some fried cheese wrap.

That is where the romance ended. First, one wine we ordered tasted as if it were watered down. I don't know any other way to describe it. We are not exactly wine snobs, but this wine was genuinely awful. We ordered a different wine and it was better, but still bad. The third was decent.

The appetizers, all fried, seemed as if they had been fried earlier and reheated somehow later. One of the fried cheese balls was actually room temperature. 
The food, both appetizers and main courses, were lacking flavor. The textures were off. Everything was slightly warm, but verging on room temperature. Felt reheated. 

The carbonara was very very sad, some of the worst we have ever had. Strange bland gnocchi. Soggy fried appetizers, caricatures of Roman classics.  The best was the caccio e pepe, which was below average. Everything was lacking punch. Depressing attempts at experimental. 

To be blunt, the food was awful. Far below average for Rome, at above average prices.

They also had a bizarre ritual of checking the reservation book before letting people in, even though they obviously knew that there were plenty of open seats. A depressing performance art. 

On the good side, the service was very attentive. Very helpful. No problems with the wait as other reviewers had described.. 

When we left, we were given a free bottle of prosecco. I am not sure if this because they thought we didn't enjoy our experience, but it was appreciated. 

Overall, this place is a tourist trap. There is a reason you don't see Italians here."
Negative,0,"Uncomfortbale and disappointingMy good friend and I decided to try Ad Hoc after many times of walking past after our full days of shopping in the city center. As soon as we walk in we were greeted by a sloppy and tacky shelf of magazines and books that hadn't been organized, dusted or paid any attention to it seemed in ages.  Ignoring this eye sore, we were seated in a tiny room with tables that were so close together that you could hear everything everyone was saying or doing and couldnt sit or eat comfortably. It was also filled with tired tourists, making the restaunt feel less genuine and more phony than one would want. Also, the room was lined with hundreds of dusty wine bottles that were very inconvienently placed at elbow level. So everytime you took a bite to eat you worried you were going to break an assumingly expensive bottle of wine. Also, to fetch a bottle of wine a waitress would have to interupt your dinner to manouevre it off the shelf. Because everything was so cluttered and cramped you felt you had to whisper and watch what you said during dinner so that the entire restaurant wouldn't hear your conversation. Not ok. So trying to ignore the tacky and cramped interior we had only high hopes for the food. The plates came out and  were very lovely, giving any reasonable person an expectaion of a delicious and gourmet meal. Every course was un utter disappointment. The food tasted like a any run of the mill restaurant, absolutely not worth the price, or even half the price. The portions were tiny and mediorcre at best though trying to be pretentious and superior. All night we had no idea who our waitress was and what language to speak to them in, as they kept mixing English and Italian. So to end a compete let down of a night I was brought the absolute worst tiramsu of all time. No exaggeration. It was disgusting. It tasted like watered down american coffee with a dollop of cream on top and soggy bread. I took one bite and pushed it away.  All in all this was a complete waste of money (as the food was insanely expensive), time, and of a perfectly good evening with a girl friend that could have been spent somewhere else more chic, tasty, authentic, and altogether more pleasant and comfortable. If you ask me, go somewhere else!"
Negative,0,"Very bad food and service - not worthy the money spentYou arrived 10 min earlier, and had to wait in the street, because they didn't offer any place to stay inside while waiting- just rude! It was November and very very cold outside.

The waitresses seem to be learning which is not expected in a place with so high prices.

The food quality was poor - I didn't finish my main course because it was unpleasant. Next morning I had an upset tummy.

It was our wedding anniversary, so they offered us a botlle of champagne, before we left, which was nice, but we're so dissapointed by that time, that didn't made the difference."
Negative,0,"Pretty dissappointing.I actually never write reviews for the restaurants, but for this one i just had to. The reason we decided to check this place out was only because of high ratings  on TA. I am still dissapointed about the choice we've made.Our dinner at this place was...well the right word for it would be BLAH... We have always dined at such wonderful places when visiting Rome before Ad Hoc. The atmosphere was very average and the way they seated people made it more uncomfortable. Do not even think to dress up for this one( even you think u r in Italy) it is very casual and reminded me of a coffee shop. I don't have anything bad to say about the service at our table, but nothing good either! They are really big on truffles on the menu, but that evening they were out of lots of things, so we did not have a lot to choose from.  The wine list is great tho. I did not see any managers on the floor, but the grumpy eastern European  looking man was very noticeable so as an owefully loud woman who was given the recipes to the guests next to us throughout our entire dinner. She was an employee or  my thought an owner and she was  really  loud to the point that I wanted to ask her to tune it down a little. Food was eatable and nothing to write home about till I got the cream brûlée. Instead of a nice and chilled on the inside and brown and crispy on the top I got Hot plate with Sprinckled  sugar on top.... My guess they just put it in the microwave instead of doing it the right way!!! Of course I didn't it touch it and we asked or the check. But no one even asked if something was wrong with it.  We did not complaint and just wanted to forget about an owefull experience , but the top position on TA list of restaurants in Rome is just making me sad again."
Negative,0,"SorryI'm afraid we were very let down by this restaurant.
We were left standing at the door for 5 minutes before being seated. We decided on the tasting menu for Land with wine. Although given a glass of prosecco when we were shown to our table, it took 35 minutes before we were served any food. 
Asparagus Roulade was overcooked.
Ravioli with Rabbit Ragout was very salty.
Ad Hoc Gnocchi were hard in the corners and I could have made a better sugo.
Saltimbocca alla Romana tasted like reconstituted meat in a roll.
Tiramisu was waterery and tasteless.
The service was fauning and pretentious.
Although I left alot on my plate uneaten I was never asked why until the dessert.
And finally as we were leaving we were given a cheap bottle of Spumante in a brown paper bag to take away. Why?
The only positive was that the wines were good.
All of this took almost 4 hours.
Would I recommend this restaurant? Absolutely not. Don't waste your time and money. There are far better places to eat in Rome."
Negative,0,"rotten starter - no apology. otherwise ok albeit overpriced10 of us ate on christmas day at Ad Hoc - we were seated in a seperate area which initally we thought would be good but ended up meaning we were ignored. One of our startes came and as we cut into the pasta dumping it was clear it was rotten (rotten fish is fairly easy to detect) we asked the waitress and she removed the plate without saying anything. our main courses came and they brought another of the starter, now without rotten crab inside but fairly empty because of it - still no apology. my aunt had eaten a piece before realising anything was wrong and was pretty upset about it.
the rest of the meal was ok but very expensive and the service continued to be pretty patchy. we werent offered anything off the bill or a dessert to say sorry - really disappointed"
Negative,0,"Overrated. Bad service.We walked in with a ressie to an empty restaurant, but for one couple. They jammed us in corner next to them, so we asked to move. She said she ""had to check""! It was absurd. They moved us begrudgingly, and we watched 3 couples get the same treatment. We did not like our food, and were disappointed."
Negative,0,"Very slow, average food, lack of wine, totally over-pricedVisited Ad Hoc for NYE with my husband and was very disappointed with the evening. It was a set menu with wine pairings for a set price of 190 Euros EACH. We arrived at 8pm and we're greeted with a small glass of prosecco, a nice touch but we then waited 1 hour for our starter and our first glass of wine. The starter was very average. We then waited 2 hours for our main and we we still hadn't had a wine refill so in the end we had to ask the waitress if we could purchase additional wine. The waitress gave us a refill but the fact we had to ask and had had 1 glass of prosecco and 1 glass of wine in 3 hours was just not good enough. The two couples next to us also asked for more wine.  One lady was literally falling asleep at the table. Two other couples were ordering espresso which we assumed was to help them to stay awake.  The main was again very average and cold. The 'sea' menu was mainly just deep fried fish and sea food. We complained again about the time it was taking and the fact that we had been without wine for a further 30 minutes (at least).  The atmosphere was awful and very flat as everyone was so frustrated and had only had 3 glasses of wine all evening so the New Year came and went without many people noticing. The couple next to us were still waiting to be served their main meal after midnight.  We had to complain twice about the time it was taking and the lack of wine which ruined the evening completely as we are not the complaining types. Overall the service was average and very, very slow, at 380 Euros for two it was completely and utterly over priced as the food at best was very average.  We believe the Ad Hoc tasting menu with wine is normally 70 Euros and I think hiking the price up to 190 Euros per person was a mistake as the food, service did not live up to the price. We have eaten at many nice restaurants and would have expected a lot more for a NYE meal for the price they charged. We wish we had popped into a local Trattoria and enjoyed the fireworks and atmosphere in the Pizazza del Popolo. Incidentally, we had planned to watch the fireworks in the Piazza del Popolo but missed them due to the fact that the meal in the end took 5 hours! A very, very disappointing evening."
Negative,0,"Poor serviceI can't comment on the food but the service was below par. We didn't have a reservation but it was still on the early side of dinner time. The restaurant had plenty of open tables however we were told they were full. When we asked about a reservation the next night we were told they were full for the next 2 nights, all this without looking at a reservation log book.
Needless to say we didn't try to dine here again."
Negative,0,"Unfortunately disappointingWe reserved a table through the website. This was very comfortable. We received a receipt. The atmorphere of the restaurant is very nice. The waitresses are very friendly, too. But it took very long until we could order. The gave us a complementary glas of prosecco. Overall the food was not really good except for the fettucine with truffels. The main course with meat was not good at all. We returned it to the kitchen. Overall the meal took 3.5 hours which was a lot of waiting. The restaurant was far too expensive for the value. After all the nice food we had in Rome in the small simple restaurants I would not go there again."
Negative,0,"Rude and inflexibleWe had a reservation for 4 people, but was joined by a 5th at the last minute. As this was a child we hoped this would not be a problem. This couldn't have been further from the truth. 

The lady that dealt with us could not have been less helpful, in fact she was bordering on rude and aggressive. If our request for an extra chair at the end of a table for 4 was so difficult for a restaurant to handle, fair enough, but at least decline our request in a polite, professional manner... Sadly not the case at Ad Hoc."
Negative,0,"Absolutely not best in Rome - Would not returnWith much anticipation we arrived for our reservation.  We were promptly seated, but then the trouble started.  It took nearly an hour for our order to be taken.  Sadly they were out of many menu items, including some featured in the hailed tasting menus.  Our dinner took nearly 4 hours with painfully slow service and most of the time with empty water and wine glasses.  Servers were completely inattentive.  I sensed that the entire dining room was annoyed with the poor service.  Food was OK, but several items on our tasting menu were cold and inedible.  Please save yourself the time and money.  There is absolutely no way that this is the best place in Rome."
Negative,0,"Expected the TA rating's and I was disapointedWalked in and didn't get in, so made a reservation, confirmed thru e-mail. Arrived on time and they made us feel unwelcomed likethere was no reservation an after all they gave us a terrible table. Next to the waiters station. (never accept that table). They where out of squid and truffle as a welcome. But surprise 50% of the menu had truffle. I asked for help with the wine list. And never got help from the maitre'd and even approached our table. Would never go back."
Negative,0,"expensive rubbishit took nearly 5 hours for them to complete our meal. They forgot to process our main course!!! Even our coffee took 30mins to arrive. What did they do go to brazil to pick the beans themselves. All this cost us 228€ for 2 of us. The food when it did arrive was average. Not to be recommended, look for where the locals go because it's not here!"
Negative,0,"A boring four and a half hours that could have been superbWe arrived at 08.15 with table booked for 08.30. No problem, made to feel very welcome. Problems started after first course.... I do not think the kitchen was able to cope with the meal orders..... seriously it took them four and a half hours to serve us our meal. The waitresses kept on apologising saying 'would not be long', 'working on yours now', 'yours is next to be cooked', etc.......
I think this is about the only restaurant I have left without leaving a tip.
It could have been superb if the kitchen timing was sorted, but the speed of non service spolit everything."
Negative,0,"How can this be the no. 1 restaurant in Rome ???There wasn't one Italian person in this place. Only tourist, who like ourselves, read the reviews on tripadvisor and decided to venture there.
While the service was kind (but as the crowd, not local), the food was over trying and disappointing. Nothing close to the traditionally simple and qualitative cuisine you expect in Italy. 
DON'T GO THERE !!!"
Negative,0,"lost the touchWe went there for all the good critics here in tripadvisor, but sadly service was terrible and ambience was boring and 1 hour to serve the appetaizer and one more for the entre. food was ok and the waitress try to be nice but not enough. wouldn´t repit."
Negative,0,TERRIBLE ATTITUDE!!!!DONT GO!!!!Terrible attitude as soon as walked in!!! Who do they think they are???
Negative,0,"This place lacks human decencyMy husband and I are in Rome for our honeymoon and read up on Ad Hoc thinking it would be a nice treat. I made the reservations online and was accepted instantly. We showed up last night at 8pm all dressed up for our reservation when the woman kept going to the back of the restaurant looking it up again while seating other people. The restaurant at this point was empty and stayed that way at least to 8:15pm. It turns out in human error on my part after visiting 3 cities in 10 days I made the reservation for tonight at 8pm instead of last night. They refused to seat us! I ask nicely telling them we are on our honeymoon and all they said was 'so sorry' and escorted us to the door as if we were trying to break in. There was no manager (that I was aware of in sight) as I can't imagine they'd let this behavoir take place. I would also like to add that it was about 85 degrees last night and this place has NO AIR CONDITIONING. A part of us were relieved to not have to eat in that smoltering heat.
After eating a very lovely meal up the street (there are tons of great places to choose from). My husband wanted to walk by Ad Hoc to see if they were 'completely booked'. Although they were more crowded they definitely could have accommodated us. We're from NYC and I honestly could never see this happening there regardless of who made the error. I'm sure this review won't affect anyones desire to try this place, but hopefully it will affect the way their staff treats people."
Negative,0,"Stay clear of this place!After a 10 day vacation in Italy we wanted to have a really special meal for the last evening (allthough I must admit our holiday was full of special meals...). Having passed the restaurant earlier in the afternoon my husband really liked the interior, and I liked that they had lobster w honeyglazed lemon on the menue, so we decided to eat there if they had a free table for us. Returning later in the evening we were greeted by a very friendly waitress and yes, they had room for us. Plenty of empty tables that evening actually (Sunday Nov. 7). Since we had been really overeating the whole trip, and I hadn´t read any reviews on this restaurant, we decided to just go for the ""secondi piatti"" and skip the antipasti. Well, good for us that we did. We did get the complementary sparkling white whine, and then went for the lobster on my part, and four try-out meat-courses for hubby.  I agree with others, the servings were really small, and our consolation in that respect was that we were in need of dieting anyway. Plates were cold, sucking the warmth out of the food. My lobster was pieces of lobster served on a square of cold, dry rice. Lobster was ok, as the strings of honey-glazed lemons. As a side order we had green asparagus with parmeggiano cheese; the asparagus wasn´t quite done so hard to chew, and the parmeggiano? Well, I am no expert, but it tasted like generic if there is such a thing when it comes to parmeggiano. Dry and tasteless! My husband's glass of wine was more like one fourth glass, and measured digitally, mind you! We wew served a basket of bread with the food without asking for it, and really didn´t touch it, but lo and behold: they charged us for the bread!!! Not even in the cheapest joint! But here, oh yes, and 3 € it was! By the time we were actually finished and served the bill by the ever-sweet waitress and noticed this we could only laugh! Thank God for speaking an unusual language (Swedish) and being able to laugh and comment on this experience at the spot.  The whole time a v ery unpleasant unsmiling man (the owner?) kept lurching in and out from the back of the restaurant. At one point one of teh waitresses seemed to try to cheer him up a bit by wrapping herself intimately around him in the back room behind our table (my seating position made it impossible for me not to notice), but to no avail. He remained very serous end stern. Everytime one of the waitresses received money from a guest he popped out to take it and check the bill, so strange, and it semed our waitress was a bit uncomfortable with this. If so eager, why didn´t he do the charging himself? All in all, a total flop for the prices they charge. There are so many other good restaurants in Rome, so do avoid this one !"
Negative,0,"Lots of fancy talk about their food and wines.All talk----no substance.Agree with all previous negative reviews.Arrived 6.20PM for6.30 reservation and told to WALK ROUND THE BLOCK FOR 10 TO 15 MINUTES. Had SEA TASTER MENU. All fancy talk but quantities MINUTE.Without being told I would not have known what Iwas 
eating in many cases.Put all courses together and might just fill a plate.BY THE WAY I am in my SEVENTIES and do not eat large courses but these were ridiculous."
Negative,0,"SHAMEFULIt was just a SHAME!

We waited for our starters for almost one hour! Just because they told us they were cutting by hand our Salumi, including Serrano Ham. I come from Spain, where, in quarter an hour you can have at least 6 traies of fresh-cut serrano ham!!! and when we told tthe waitress how slow they were she replied as if we where the guilty ones who had chosen that starter and knew how long it took it to prepare it! (on top of that the ham wasn`t even good)
Moreover it took us half an hour to have the bill!!
For God`s sake! I really encourage you not to go there!!!"
Negative,0,"disappointing - after reading such great reviewsI was in Rome this weekend and i had booked a table here 2 weeks prior to me arriving.
Their website stated that you would be welcomed with a glass of Prosecco (f.o.c), well we were not.
We were put at a table and left, then the waitress came back and asked if we would like some water. We were then left alone again.
While we were sat waiting for the menu and wine menu, we had an Italian couple come and sit next to us. Within seconds they had 2 glasses of Prosecco and all the menus they could ask for.
When the waitress returned she gave us our menu and said she would be back in 5, (we had been there for 20 mins) to take our order. At this point i decided not to stay and when the waitress returned i said could we pay for the water, and we were leaving.
When she asked why i stated that it was because i felt as if i had been treated like an idiot. Stating that thier website says they offer a free glass of Prosecco as a welcome gift, and we hadnt recieved one (when the couple on the next table did), she said that it was not a problem and offered to get us a glass, but that wasnt the point. I also said that we hadnt been given a menu for a while and i just felt that because i wasnt Italian that i was being treated unfairly ...... ( I happen to have proposed to my girlfriend earlier on in the day and was really looking forward to a lovely meal) which we did have elsewhere.
Sorry to be a bummer but i was gutted.."
Negative,0,Ad Hoc - yes some of the details of this restaurant are ad hocWe had a fab break in Rome for my 40th; the meal at Glass Hostaria was a highlight and we hoped for the same the following night at Ad Hoc as we'd read so many good reviews but it failed to reach our expectations. The maitre d'/sommelier seemed knowledgable and efficient but the dishes just did not deliver; I had the sea bass which had been taken off the bone badly so I was fishing out needle bones all through the meal and the nice potatoes they served with it were cold. My husband had a steak which was fine and a side order of fried potatoes which turned out to be frozen chips! We waited 40 minutes for the bill and I don't think for a bill of over £120 frozen anything is acceptable.
Negative,0,"“Ad hoc” rudeness!“Ad hoc” rudeness!!!
Terrible restaurant, rude and presumptuous staff!!! Poor food with portions of a starred restaurant even if it doesn't have any stars! Not recommended especially for foreign tourists!"
Negative,0,"How not to be disappointed?It was presented to us as one of the best Roman restaurants.
But had it not been for the setting, with so many beautiful bottles on the walls, and the kindness of the service, there was nothing but disappointment on the plate, whether it was the zucchini flowers with ricotta or the fresh pasta with summer truffles, tasteless and spoiled by the presence of useless grass. We will salute the Ornellaia which allowed us to dine on a more festive note."
Negative,0,"Overrated and touristyUnfortunately the food was just average. No dish was really convincing. The greeting from the kitchen was okay but not a highlight in terms of taste.

The tartare had a bland taste and relied on the fact that it was served with truffles. The artichoke stuffed with yarn didn't actually taste like anything.

The carbonara tasted good but was a bit too salty.

Unfortunately, the desserts were completely ill-thought out. I had mine returned too.

All dishes lack that certain something.

The wine list was great. Unfortunately the selection of open wines was not good."
Negative,0,"Bad tasting food difficult to digestWe didn't like the food that much.

The starters were tasteless

and hard to digest.

Not to be recommended, look for where the locals go because it's not here!"
Negative,0,"A boring four and a half hours that could have been superbWe arrived at 08.15 with table booked for 08.30. No problem, made to feel very welcome. Problems started after first course.... I do not think the kitchen was able to cope with the meal orders..... seriously it took them four and a half hours to serve us our meal. The waitresses kept on apologising saying 'would not be long', 'working on yours now', 'yours is next to be cooked', etc.......
I think this is about the only restaurant I have left without leaving a tip.
It could have been superb if the kitchen timing was sorted, but the speed of non service spolit everything."
Negative,0,"How can this be the no. 1 restaurant in Rome ???There wasn't one Italian person in this place. Only tourist, who like ourselves, read the reviews on tripadvisor and decided to venture there.
While the service was kind (but as the crowd, not local), the food was over trying and disappointing. Nothing close to the traditionally simple and qualitative cuisine you expect in Italy. 
DON'T GO THERE !!!"
Negative,0,"lost the touchWe went there for all the good critics here in tripadvisor, but sadly service was terrible and ambience was boring and 1 hour to serve the appetaizer and one more for the entre. food was ok and the waitress try to be nice but not enough. wouldn´t repit."
Negative,0,TERRIBLE ATTITUDE!!!!DONT GO!!!!Terrible attitude as soon as walked in!!! Who do they think they are???
Negative,0,"This place lacks human decencyMy husband and I are in Rome for our honeymoon and read up on Ad Hoc thinking it would be a nice treat. I made the reservations online and was accepted instantly. We showed up last night at 8pm all dressed up for our reservation when the woman kept going to the back of the restaurant looking it up again while seating other people. The restaurant at this point was empty and stayed that way at least to 8:15pm. It turns out in human error on my part after visiting 3 cities in 10 days I made the reservation for tonight at 8pm instead of last night. They refused to seat us! I ask nicely telling them we are on our honeymoon and all they said was 'so sorry' and escorted us to the door as if we were trying to break in. There was no manager (that I was aware of in sight) as I can't imagine they'd let this behavoir take place. I would also like to add that it was about 85 degrees last night and this place has NO AIR CONDITIONING. A part of us were relieved to not have to eat in that smoltering heat.
After eating a very lovely meal up the street (there are tons of great places to choose from). My husband wanted to walk by Ad Hoc to see if they were 'completely booked'. Although they were more crowded they definitely could have accommodated us. We're from NYC and I honestly could never see this happening there regardless of who made the error. I'm sure this review won't affect anyones desire to try this place, but hopefully it will affect the way their staff treats people."
Negative,0,"Stay clear of this place!After a 10 day vacation in Italy we wanted to have a really special meal for the last evening (allthough I must admit our holiday was full of special meals...). Having passed the restaurant earlier in the afternoon my husband really liked the interior, and I liked that they had lobster w honeyglazed lemon on the menue, so we decided to eat there if they had a free table for us. Returning later in the evening we were greeted by a very friendly waitress and yes, they had room for us. Plenty of empty tables that evening actually (Sunday Nov. 7). Since we had been really overeating the whole trip, and I hadn´t read any reviews on this restaurant, we decided to just go for the ""secondi piatti"" and skip the antipasti. Well, good for us that we did. We did get the complementary sparkling white whine, and then went for the lobster on my part, and four try-out meat-courses for hubby.  I agree with others, the servings were really small, and our consolation in that respect was that we were in need of dieting anyway. Plates were cold, sucking the warmth out of the food. My lobster was pieces of lobster served on a square of cold, dry rice. Lobster was ok, as the strings of honey-glazed lemons. As a side order we had green asparagus with parmeggiano cheese; the asparagus wasn´t quite done so hard to chew, and the parmeggiano? Well, I am no expert, but it tasted like generic if there is such a thing when it comes to parmeggiano. Dry and tasteless! My husband's glass of wine was more like one fourth glass, and measured digitally, mind you! We wew served a basket of bread with the food without asking for it, and really didn´t touch it, but lo and behold: they charged us for the bread!!! Not even in the cheapest joint! But here, oh yes, and 3 € it was! By the time we were actually finished and served the bill by the ever-sweet waitress and noticed this we could only laugh! Thank God for speaking an unusual language (Swedish) and being able to laugh and comment on this experience at the spot.  The whole time a v ery unpleasant unsmiling man (the owner?) kept lurching in and out from the back of the restaurant. At one point one of teh waitresses seemed to try to cheer him up a bit by wrapping herself intimately around him in the back room behind our table (my seating position made it impossible for me not to notice), but to no avail. He remained very serous end stern. Everytime one of the waitresses received money from a guest he popped out to take it and check the bill, so strange, and it semed our waitress was a bit uncomfortable with this. If so eager, why didn´t he do the charging himself? All in all, a total flop for the prices they charge. There are so many other good restaurants in Rome, so do avoid this one !"
Negative,0,"Lots of fancy talk about their food and wines.All talk----no substance.Agree with all previous negative reviews.Arrived 6.20PM for6.30 reservation and told to WALK ROUND THE BLOCK FOR 10 TO 15 MINUTES. Had SEA TASTER MENU. All fancy talk but quantities MINUTE.Without being told I would not have known what Iwas 
eating in many cases.Put all courses together and might just fill a plate.BY THE WAY I am in my SEVENTIES and do not eat large courses but these were ridiculous."
Negative,0,"SHAMEFULIt was just a SHAME!

We waited for our starters for almost one hour! Just because they told us they were cutting by hand our Salumi, including Serrano Ham. I come from Spain, where, in quarter an hour you can have at least 6 traies of fresh-cut serrano ham!!! and when we told tthe waitress how slow they were she replied as if we where the guilty ones who had chosen that starter and knew how long it took it to prepare it! (on top of that the ham wasn`t even good)
Moreover it took us half an hour to have the bill!!
For God`s sake! I really encourage you not to go there!!!"
Negative,0,"disappointing - after reading such great reviewsI was in Rome this weekend and i had booked a table here 2 weeks prior to me arriving.
Their website stated that you would be welcomed with a glass of Prosecco (f.o.c), well we were not.
We were put at a table and left, then the waitress came back and asked if we would like some water. We were then left alone again.
While we were sat waiting for the menu and wine menu, we had an Italian couple come and sit next to us. Within seconds they had 2 glasses of Prosecco and all the menus they could ask for.
When the waitress returned she gave us our menu and said she would be back in 5, (we had been there for 20 mins) to take our order. At this point i decided not to stay and when the waitress returned i said could we pay for the water, and we were leaving.
When she asked why i stated that it was because i felt as if i had been treated like an idiot. Stating that thier website says they offer a free glass of Prosecco as a welcome gift, and we hadnt recieved one (when the couple on the next table did), she said that it was not a problem and offered to get us a glass, but that wasnt the point. I also said that we hadnt been given a menu for a while and i just felt that because i wasnt Italian that i was being treated unfairly ...... ( I happen to have proposed to my girlfriend earlier on in the day and was really looking forward to a lovely meal) which we did have elsewhere.
Sorry to be a bummer but i was gutted.."
Negative,0,Ad Hoc - yes some of the details of this restaurant are ad hocWe had a fab break in Rome for my 40th; the meal at Glass Hostaria was a highlight and we hoped for the same the following night at Ad Hoc as we'd read so many good reviews but it failed to reach our expectations. The maitre d'/sommelier seemed knowledgable and efficient but the dishes just did not deliver; I had the sea bass which had been taken off the bone badly so I was fishing out needle bones all through the meal and the nice potatoes they served with it were cold. My husband had a steak which was fine and a side order of fried potatoes which turned out to be frozen chips! We waited 40 minutes for the bill and I don't think for a bill of over £120 frozen anything is acceptable.
Negative,0,"How not to be disappointed?It was presented to us as one of the best Roman restaurants.
But had it not been for the setting, with so many beautiful bottles on the walls, and the kindness of the service, there was nothing but disappointment on the plate, whether it was the zucchini flowers with ricotta or the fresh pasta with summer truffles, tasteless and spoiled by the presence of useless grass. We will salute the Ornellaia which allowed us to dine on a more festive note."
Positive,1,"WonderfulWe booked the Frog in advance and pleased we did as it was very busy…

Positive,1,Great find in the heart of Bercy VillageWhat a neat little micro brewery at Bercy Village! We just strolled through the village and stopped in for a drink at happy hour.

Although the Chefs and the venue were very good, the standout service by David (a new member) and Nicholas were as good as anything we have enjoyed during our week in France. David was attentive, funny and able to sort all of our needs in a very efficient manner. We hope you all get to enjoy David’s service approach and that this rubs off onto all other staff. Culture is everything and David has it in spades!! Well done. Please bring Frogs to Australia and Adelaide especially. Congratulations to you all on a job well done. Geoff and Julianne"

Came in for happy hour and was served by Nicolas B., who is just as good at carrying on conversation with new patrons as he is at mixing exceptional drinks.  The fish and chips were phenomenal. 

Had such a great experience that I came back for dinner the next night, and had the pleasure of being served by Christine, who was equally as pleasant and cool! She recommended a double bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. She speaks three languages and will tell you all you need to know about France and the 12th! Thank you’ Nico and Chrissy!

We had planned to go back gor a second film but we found the day so lovely and the atmosphere here so relaxed we stayed for dessert and a good gossip session with cheesecake (yum) and a cocktail in the gorm of passion fruit caipirinha (delish). The service from our lovely server Mina was impeccable; speedy and friendly but never intrusive. She was attentive replacing our water carafes without us asking, never put us under any pressure to leave even though we were there several hours in the end, spoke excellent English and generally made our afternoon easy and comfortable and we both felt very at home! 10/10 this will become our regular post movie hangout!"

The Craft Beer selection is very good as well."

I definetly have a good time again."

Doesn't look like a fancy place from the outside but you will be surprised once you go in. It's huge with a good atmosphere.

Positive,1,"Fish and Chips in a Quaint Setting in FranceThe Frog is a place where my wife and I have eaten in the Bercy Village area of France.  It is British pub food with microbrews made in-house.  It can be very busy and noisy, but is a nice place to relax and enjoy a cold one."
Positive,1,"Great burgers and good beerHad a couple of days in Bercy, and we tried a couple of things from the menu. 

The burgers were great, and they even had sweet potato fries that were really good. 

We traveled with children, and they enjoyed this restaurant also. They got something to play and draw with from the nice staff, and they were served children's menu that wasn't to expensive. 

The restaurant makes the beer them self, and as a beer enthusiast this is great. A lot of good beers. A little expensive beers but really good. 

All in all a good and relaxed restaurant that we will visit again if we got the possibility.

Positive,1,"Good beer, great terraceWe stopped here after a visit to a nearby museum and had a few cold beers.  The beers were tasty and the food that the kids ordered was pretty good.

Positive,1,"American Pub in FranceStayed in a hotel very close to this property and was looking for American style food. The Frog was written up as very ""American."" The reviews were entirely correct! Even my waiter was from the States.

Really pretty pub located in the quant but modern Bercy Villiage. Inviting and very friendly staff, the service was outstanding.  Tried the ""Empire"" home brew and it was excellent. Ordered the Fish and Chips to go with the beer and it turned out to be the perfect combo. 

I'll be back!"
Positive,1,"Friday lunchAfternoon lunch on an International Rugby weekend.  Warmly welcomed and shown promptly to a table.  Drinks and food brought quickly and with a smile.

Positive,1,Apres judoGreat atmosphere. Good service even when its busy. Good selection of beers. Close to our hotel just a short walk across the road.
Positive,1,Amazing ambianceHaving a great time at this awesome pub. Great food (I had the Cesar salad) A must try are the sweet potato fries. We also had an amazing time thanks to our server Marco : very nice and in a good mood. The music is also another reason why I come back.
Positive,1,best place to get drinks on weekends.what an atmosphere !! we were there in the weekends and the whole place was packed . loved the service and the people . we stayed only for a few drinks as we had to check out the other bars in the locality .
Positive,1,"Buzzing friendly jointAt the end of a long and freezing work day in France, this lively and warm restaurant/bar was a welcome and relaxing find.  

The bouncy waitress who greeted me at the door, Rochelle, spoke excellent English despite her French-looking name, so I didn't have to struggle with my poor French. Bonus #1 :)  

The place was packed and the only single seat Rochelle could find for me was in an obscure corner, kinda close to the toilets I think.  Before I had managed a few sips of my beer a more suitable table closer to the centre of the activity became available and the waitress offered for me to move there. That was nice. Bonus #2

I had a Hopster beer and the Crunchy Chicken (Caeser?) Salad, both of which came out in a respectable time, and complimented the lively and fresh atmosphere of the pub perfectly.  Bonus #3 and #4.  

A very pleasant evening, and conveniently close to a metro station (Bonus #5!)"
Positive,1,"Smiley and well-informed staffWe visited the frog last night and although we had to wait a little for a table, once we were seated the service was very efficient. Our waitress Rochelle knew lots about the beers and was constantly smiling! The food was okay (the beers were even better!!) and the service was great."
Positive,1,"Good pub food and beerBercy village is a trendy place with lots of bistros and bars. The frog is an American bar style place with lots of good food and beer - burgers, ribs etc. Very busy but service still good."
Positive,1,"""Yummy""A group of us ended our trip of Europe at this fine restaurant. We wanted to enjoy a few pints as well as some dinner items in a relaxed fashion. This place hit the bill. Great service, awesome food choices, cold and a decent variety of beers, great ambiance. I had the crispy chicken tacos which were very good. Fish and chips were greasy and yummy. Went over real well with the beer. All in all a great way to spend our last evening in France."
Positive,1,"Several good beer choices on tap.Large, Casual pub, with inside and outside seating. The outside is great for people watching in Bercy village."
Positive,1,"LunchHad lunch at The Frog, good choice of burgers, tacos and beers. Waiters very friendly, always smiling ... cheers to Oscar, our waiter who welcomed us warmly and with the smile on. Good place for a quick lunch at Bercy Village."
Positive,1,"Real beer!We didn't eat here but the food looked good, I was there for the Ale, wonderful!, the stout ""Francelitic"" was so light but creamy and delicious, ""Wham"" an American type beer but hoppy and citrus due to Cascade hops was awesome, tried a pint of ""Inseine""......; our waiter was the most friendly guy, he took me to see the ""set up"", had a good talk with the ""Brewer""; France water is so purified that it has no character so they have to add gypsum and lactic acid etc, great pub, would go there again if France wasn't so crumy."
Positive,1,"A tasty haloumi burger - served by English-speaking staffMy wife and I had an hour or so to kill before our movie was to start so we stopped at The Frog for drinks and a bite to eat. We thought that our waiter, George (a lovely English chap), was doing very well in such a busy French restaurant. Although his French was perfectly fine, it was a pleasure to be able to speak English with him. He looked after us well. We did think it a shame that there was only one (slightly expensive) cider available and none on tap. The wait-time was quite reasonable, considering the place was packed out. We enjoyed the haloumi burger and kumara fries (a rare treat for a kiwi) and would certainly dine there again."
Positive,1,"Nice brunch -Great WaitressWe had brunch with my husband this Sunday and were very lucky to have the most efficient waitress I have ever met. Kristin made our brunch a great experience. She was pro-active, gave us great advices and all with a nice smile. we had the American pancakes and the Halloumi & eggs brunch then shared a great New York cheesecake."
Positive,1,"great place and cozy ambiancequite big &very comfortable setting.
went in for last minute drinks with friends and the staff were incredibly welcoming and lovely

shoutout to yumiko and pablo for their best efforts, as well as the barman on the second floor.

a comeback is definitely expected
thank you!!"
Positive,1,"Fun place.We visited twice and were treatd well.  I am not fond of their craft brews, but that is me.  I have only a few beers I enjoy."
Positive,1,"American style dinerAmerican style diner.
Very cozy place.
Friendly staff.
They make their own beer and it is very good.
Worth trying."
Positive,1,Great time!The food was great! Our waitress Donika was serving at the top of her game. Very friendly and beautiful environment.
Positive,1,"OutstandingIt was my second time in this restaurant and I loved everything there. Good service, amazing food and reasonable price. The wine menu is great with a beautiful dinning room in the wine cave and you can also have a table outside and enjoy the perfect view of nervy village."
Positive,1,"American Style burger placeIf you're homesick for American food, this is the place where you can feel back at home with burgers, fries and beer."
Positive,1,"Good beer and good foodI had 2 of their home brewed blind beers, very nice, followed by a cheese burger, the burger was very good too. The service was fast and friendly, I would recommend this place to eat and drink"
Positive,1,Good cafeIs is nice and nice area. Food and beverage just fine and you should try something new in there. Then take a walk in the village.
Positive,1,"A fun stop in the city of lightWe'd heard that Frog was a great place to grab beer and we weren't disappointed!
The staff were really very friendly and especially Stéphanie, who, with her beautiful smile, really gave our visit that little extra.
I'll be sure to stop by and say hi next time I visit France!

Cheers!"
Positive,1,"Leo the waiterOur first night in France and a great start, Leo was really helpful and gave us advice and service we really appreciated. Ask for Leo when you go in"
Positive,1,"Great LunchWent with my son when visiting France and it was his suggestion. The place is part of a chain. Service was fantastic from the time we arrived till we left. Choice of seating and we picked a table downstairs where you can see them making the beer. There is a good selection of craft beers/ales of which we tried two, both of which were exceptional. We had the 'Revolution' and 'Pulled Pork' burgers which were both excellent but decided against a desert in favour of another pint!!! Less than 50 euros for the two of us which I think is good value in France. Will go there again and we would both recommend it."
Positive,1,"Great value for money!!We visited here for a meal before we headed off to the England v France match. The place was buzzing! Packed with loads of England fans and Wales v Italy on the big screen. They serve their own beers and basic burgers. The food arrived quickly and was very tasty and good value. Very good service! It doesn't have any pretensions about it's food, it is what it is. If you want a tasty, well cooked burger at a reasonable price, this is the place!

Best part of the visit was explaining to the French waitress why all the England fans were cheering for Italy…..!! ;-)"
Positive,1,"Lively placeNice area, great atmosphere, interesting choice of ales and good service. 
My only criticism is tables are too close together so you feel like sardines in a tin!"
Positive,1,"Great locationThe Frog in Bercy village is a reasonably priced place serving american style food, great service, tables so close to each other but packed constantly, large indoor seating and outdoor seating with heaters etc. The cheapest bottle of win in France the whole time we were there at 20 euro's, just a pity it was a £4 Hardy's Australian Chardonnay"
Positive,1,"American food in bercy villageDecent food for a normal price in a touristique area. Burgers were OK, barbeque was good. Service was really friendly and helpfull. Bit crowded and noisy. Tried couple of homebrew Beers and they were good and unique. Would give 3,5 for food and price. But service and beer are worth a 4"
Positive,1,"Bercy Frog ++good food,waiters nice and quick service.Great atmosphere and decoration ++ nice location,close the movie theatre"
Positive,1,"Good food, decent pricingWe had the hamburger and fish and chips Both were decent potrtions. You can't get a medium rare hamburger in the States but you can in France. The fish was really good but only complaint is you only get one piece. Atmosphere is good, tables are crowded together, service was good."
Positive,1,"Pleasant and charmingNice, quirky little place in Bercy Village. Good range of beers and other drinks. Visited on a Thursday afternoon and was quite busy, can imagine it's close to bursting at the weekends. Friendly atmosphere and quite relaxed."
Positive,1,"Great beer and food plus watched American FootballGreat beer and food plus watched American Football. Leo our waiter was  awesome and very accommodating to us Americans, as well as the manager in putting on the big screen the playoff game between Minnesota and  Seattle. The beer was great as well as the food."
Positive,1,"DrinksLovely atmosphere. Staff are on point, on the most part, though seemed to be very busy. Really nice place, nice location as well..."
Positive,1,"Very attentive staff.Aside from the food, this one is memorable for the exceptional service provided by their staff especially Laura. Very attentive. Even made a customized drink for me."
Positive,1,"Excellent Beer but disappointing foodWe came across The Frog by chance as we walked around Bercy Village after a stroll in the lovely Bercy Park that it backs on to. We were surprised to find a microbrewery in France so decided to try it. There was a good selection of beers that seemed to be brewed on the premises. The pale ale was excellent and certainly worth the visit.
However, we were feeling peckish and decided to order some food. The food selection was very much international pub food and we had the sharing plate. It consisted of prawns in batter, deep fried Camembert , and rather greasy nachos. Not something that made us want to try any of the other dishes so we had another beer and headed elsewhere to eat."
Positive,1,"Burger restaurant with homebrewed beerThis is a place to go with friends, before or after going to the nearby movie theater. Young crowd, friendly service, nice burgers, homemade beer. I just wish they served the burgers on a plate, not on a pastic tray with a paper cover that shreds into pieces if you eat your burger with fork and knife."
Positive,1,"Quick visitI went there with some friends. The waiters were nice and quick. The drinks were good depending on personal taste. We didn't eat, so i cant review the food there. The decoration of the place is great. The atmosphere was good. The best thing was the humongous tv screen displaying a PSG soccer match that night."
Positive,1,"Great craft beer pub in Bercy Village with good foodThe Frog at Bercy Village is a great craft beer pub in Bercy Village serving their own fine brew!

It's great to find a craft beer pub when away with work that has a good selection of beers particularly when the pub brews it themselves. I highly recommend the Natural Blonde beer!

As well as sampling their fine beer I have also eaten in The Frog on a couple of occasions. The service has always been excellent even when very busy on a Friday night. I would highly recommend any of their burgers!

Overall a good place for good beer and good food."
Positive,1,"Great experience but do not go just for the foodOffers basic British/America pub style food (burgers, etc.) and they also brew their own beer. Great fun with a group but can be noisy. This is the place to go if you want to eat/drink and watch sport on a big screen."
Positive,1,"Very nice ""watering hole"" !What a superb bar and restaurant. Has it's own micro brewery and I particularly enjoyed a beer called ""FranceLYTIC"" ! Think about it, because a couple of these will see you in a very comfortable frame of mind. Sports type of bar as well so a lot going on. Great atmosphere particularly in the evening. Should be more places like this"
Positive,1,"Great DrinksDrinks here at the end of a long day.  Very busy place but great to sit up at the bar, watch a bit of sports on the TV and great cocktails.  Great way to end a day of sightseeing.  I would have rated a bit higher, but it was so hot inside the venue, it was uncomfortable to stay any longer than 2 drinks."
Positive,1,"The best in Bercy VillageA very nice pub in the Bercy Village, where you can have a great local beer. Just choose your beer style, ask for the big jar and share it with friends or your lover."
Positive,1,great burgersTry the pulled pork burger it is out of this world! They could add some variety to their beers Although what they had was good. Waiters need to be a bit more attentive.
Positive,1,Tasty BeerWell worth a visit to the Microbrewery. Enjoyed a couple of pints of Blonde Beer and tried the Wham! Staff were helpful and friendly.
Positive,1,"Excellent beers and coctailsOur last night in France we visited there. The menu is in French but waiter translated for us.  Excelent beers and coctails. We ordered nachos, chicken wings, burgers. Everything was very tasty. Defenetly will visit thete again."
Positive,1,"Quick lunchThe food and drinking are very good. I also found the micro-brewing operation very interesting, particularly as one of the staff members noticed me admiring the vats and talked me through their process. We liked it so much we went back in an evening just for drinks. Good crowd of locals and tourists."
Positive,1,Great mealVisited The Frog whilst stopping off in France on way home from south of France. Fabulous meal and staff couldn't have been more helpful. Really speedy service despite being run off their feet. Will definitely be visiting again next time we're in France !
Positive,1,"Great late night bar and food place...We went to the Frog in Bercy village to grab some late night food and drink as it's open until 3am on a Saturday, the frog is a delightful pub chain and microbrewery, the staff are very pleasant, laid back and helpful and look like they are enjoying themselves. 

We sat outside in the terrase it's very cosy and a great atmosphere, shame you can't hear some of the great music playing inside.. 

The food is good gastro-pub food, and I had the haloumi burger, which was the vegetarian option.. Very delightful and tasty, a great choice. We were tempted by dessert but having seen how large they were declined..  And decided to stick to the rather large drinks menu that they have.

Later we headed inside to continue our evening and listen to the music.. Which the staff were enjoying as well.. It's a fun place to be in and in a great location in this old converted wine storage areas."
Positive,1,lovely food!Lovely food worth going to! Had the tortilla chips they were amazing and the chicken ceaser salad!! Not badly priced. The wifi is very poor though.
Positive,1,"GOOD GRUB & BEERWe where staying in the Ibis hotel opposite Bercy Village and wondered across one evening looking for something to eat 
we chose The Frog as hubby like's trying new beers and we could get something English to eat (i know boring !!lol) 
we sat outside as it was a warm evening & the Atmosphere was Perfect , hubby had a burger which he really enjoyed (& he eats alot of burgers) and i had fish& chips with minted mushy peas Yummy 
then hubby had a peanut butter stack & i had the oreo stack mmmmmmm yum yum 
all the food was lovely and hubby enjoyed the beer 
the staff where lovely really friendly and very helpful , we had a Great evening and would say give it a go"
Positive,1,Well priced food and great atmosphereThis place in the heart of Bercy is alive and great fun. Our  waiter was fun to deal with coping with our broken French and his Italian with English in the middle. All the waiters seemed joyful and helpful. Worth another visit.
Positive,1,"Good Frog beerJust had one beer there but it was a good one. It's from their microbrewery (Frog). We were outside but the place seem to have a big place inside. 

I didn't try their food, but they do have some. Pub style food."
Positive,1,"Great beerWe only stopped for beers, so I can't comment on the food. The beer was really good. I had the Ginger Twist, and it was unlike any other Amber beer that I've tried before. You could really taste the lime. Hubby had the Maison Blanche. It was also a great patio to people watch. Would recommend to someone going to Bercy Village."
Positive,1,"An evening drinks with friends/colleaguesGreat place to spend an evening with nice cocktails, delicious snacks à la carte and big place for groups !! Have fun..."
Positive,1,Bonbon!Super place to eat in France that wont cost too much! Visited 2 yrs ago however i had forgotten its name and never left a review! Good value for money and great atmosphere!
Positive,1,"The beer placeHome brewed beer don't disappoint. They are also good at beer snacks from fried onions, chicken wings to burgers and salads. After 20 expect quite a crowd."
Positive,1,"Home-made beer was quite delicious.We were occuppying a table of 15 people. It was different from what I've encountered in other pubs in France. The service was much better, especially while dealing with large groups entering the pub. I was satisfied with the blond waitress Carol, who was very attentive and friendly. It would be nice to have more options on the menu, since it's such a big pub, but, for the time being, it's pretty cool."
Positive,1,"Very goodGreat bar in a great location with a fantastic buzz.. Go here! 
Good service and good value for a major city"
Positive,1,"Fish and ChipsA nice lunch in the sunshine, fish and chips were ""mostly authentic"" and crispy chicken burger was tasty.  Choice of wine could be wider, there's only 1 option for white (aussie chardonnay) and pink (cotes de provence). Serving staff were efficient and pleasant."
Positive,1,"British-Style Pub in the Pretty Bércy Quartier. Micro-Brewery, too!Best of The Frog chain of British-style pubs in France (also in one of the prettiest parts of France, Bércy).

The Frog at Bércy Village is located very close to Bércy underground station (about a 1 minute walk). Bércy Village, actually, is a short secluded lane with restaurants and shops on either side, not really a village after all. Bércy is the actual quartier. Close by is one of the many wonderful France attractions, La Cinémathéque Francaise (see my review). One more reason to go there.

The Frog Bércy is the prettiest of a chain of 4 British-style Pubs in central France, it's also a microbrewery. Their ales are British style (IPA, best bitter, stout - plus a Hoegaarden like lemony ale), and of very good quality. Admittedly, the prices for these beers are € 5 and up, so effectively even more expensive than in London. But then, France is the rip-off to end all other rip-offs, and beer prices can go up to € 10 for 500ml (not even a pint!). € 5 per glass are called ""happy hour"" around here! It's not even a tourist rip-off, because the French are always happy to rip off their own countrymen, too, in one fell swoop.

I had a couple of fine real ales there and fish and chips (what else!). The portion wasn't huge, but to compensate for that, it was small. The fish was of excellent quality, crisp, with a good bite and firm texture - the chips were a bit flabby, just like the ones you get at many British pubs. Home, sweet [spiritual] home. ;)

The decor is very pleasant indeed, and emphasizes the ""dual"" British-French nature of the pub. Despite the slightly inflated prices, the pub is extremely busy at lunch *and* dinner times. Well, it's a nice neighborhood after all.

Service is decidedly French, i.e. a bit snooty, generally inefficient and a tad slow. It's all part of the folklore, isn't it?"
Positive,1,"Great as alwaysIf you want to enjoy a beer and a burger in a British style pub, the Frog is the place to go. Their craft beer is great (try the Dark or the Inseine) and their food is really good. The waiters are also very pleasant and you can easily discuss with them (in English of course).

One of the best places for a few beers with friends or colleagues."
Positive,1,Fish and Chips with New York CheesecakeWe had a great meal here of fish and chips and New York cheesecake. The place is so France and the toilets are clean.  The hamburgers looks huge and wonderful.
Positive,1,"Best Fish and Chips... and a place for beer snobs too!I know, when you are in France, why would you want to eat at a British style pub?  Well... because the food is AMAZEBALLS!  

My husband and I came here one night, both hungry as we just walked about 10 miles through the city.  Ordered up the fish and chips, and they were the best fish and chips I have ever had!  We both agreed, this was the best food we had while we were in France. It was so good, that we went back again the next night for dinner.  

The other cool thing about this place, is that they have microbrews.  Now, where I come from, beer is a religion.  I am not a beer drinker, but my husband is and he brews his own.  Frogs has a great brewery set up and from what I heard, really good beer. 

So, if you want great fish and chips and an excellent beer - go here... you won't be disappointed!"
Positive,1,"Amazing staff, good food!The Frog was a go-to destination for me when I was in France. Good drinks, atmosphere and menu options as well as an excellent mix of French and English speaking waitstaff. Loved the burgers!"
Positive,1,Great PubBuzzing and great service with a good range of drinks. Possibly a little bit too much deep fat frying  but that seems to be the vogue for bar snacks these days!
Positive,1,"very good therefore very crowdedVery good place with big varieties of food options staff is nice, welcoming and speak good English you can hardly find a place inside but outside is nice and warm with the heater"
Positive,1,"great place to hang out after office hoursI went here with a friend after office hours, it was queuing that time, but we were quite lucky to get a seat after 5 min waiting.
The specialty from this restaurant is the beer, they have a lot of variance of local beer and also cocktail-beer
The food is average, its more to burger, chicken wings, etc, but you dont have to wait for long for the food to come."
Positive,1,"Brews own beers!This is a wonderful setting in Bercy Village (Cour St Emilion). Very authentic, very british! The staf is very friendly, even on an early sunday morning. 
Plates are delicious, tough 'real fresh belgian french fries' aren't the same as the real ones in Belgium. 
We took the brunch formula and was very tasteful! Prices are a little high."
Positive,1,"Great Veggie Burgers!!This was our first meal in Bercy and well worth the decision to eat there.  The food was excellent.  Not cheap but it is France in August so what you would expect!  The waiter was lovely, very friendly and accommodating.  Would definitely return AND it was the only place that had anything remotely vegetarian for my daughter :)"
Positive,1,It's not badWas a little slow to bring the beer out but the food is good and if you're a working Brit and need a beer and club sandwich it's OK.
Positive,1,great burgersGood service and good food. Very good waiters helpful and polite. Went through the menu to make sure that we knew what it all was and what we would get.
Positive,1,"Nice breakIt's a bar. They serve bar food (hamburger, nachos etc) so don't expect a fancy meal. But, the atmosphere is great, they got good beer and the food, although basic, is of good quality. Staff is very friendly. Be prepared for some wait at peak times and on weekends. It's a popular place for a reason."
Positive,1,"Great home-brewed beers!A range of excellent beers brewed on the premises, you are served a full pint (not 50cl) and during happy hour (mon-fri eves to 8.00pm) a pint costs € 5.00 (€ 6.50 at other times, but still great value for France!). Friendly atmosphere.  We visited twice and would have visited more often if time allowed."
Positive,1,Micro brewery pubThis is a great British type pub that brews it's own beer which are excellent but pricey. The staff are very friendly and the food is good too. It was very busy on the Saturday night we visited with a good atmosphere and a young crowd and there is a big screen for all the sporting events.
Positive,1,"American burger and beer barA nice restaurant located in the Bercy Village.
Serves gourmet burgers and fries.
Several beers that are unique to the restaurant are served.
The restaurant offers a large menu and beverages but I have only enjoyed their burgers and fries and specialty beers.
The decor is bland, nothing special, cramped and loud. A bar food type feel to it.
But don't let this scare you away. This is a great place to get an American style burger, fries and beer."
Positive,1,"Lively, friendly, great beerWe were pleasantly surprised to see such a thriving venue mid week. We were served by a helpful, polite and friendly young man. We got a paddle of sample beers to make our choice before ordering a pint. (Pints aren't cheap in France). We ordered a couple of starters. The food was a good portion size & hot.  We would visit again to try a different beer and a main course!! Our moan would be no napkins and we ordered 'finger food'"
Positive,1,Visit from AustraliaWe had dinner at this restaurant/hotel & really enjoyed it. They brew their own beer & you can have a sample of all brewed. They bring it to you on a tray with 6 to try. Meal was enjoyable & we had a lovely young man that served us & looke dafter us for our evening out. Thank you .
Positive,1,"Best BurgersWho goes to France and eats a burger at 10:30pm?  A person who is starving from touring all day.  Was the burger good, you ask?  Well, yeah..not just good but excellent.  Thank God, the French eat late and The Frog was brimming with people.  We were able to get our order in just before the kitchen closed thanks to Sandra, our waitress (she was attentive, fast and spoke good english ).  I thought the burger might have been that good because I was hungry.  I went back two nights later and the burger was excellent again.  What can you say about that?  Consistent and Excellent."
Positive,1,"A gem!We were amused at the thought of an ""English"" pub in the Franceian suburbs so went in to take a look.  We expected a tawdry, tacky version of an English pub but we were truly surprised.  It was a large establishment which you could enter from the park side or the ""village"" side.  On the first floor the coppers used for the brewery were gleaming.  The staff were fabulous and friendly and the menu looked like any pub menu but the quality of the food was excellent."
Positive,1,"Welcome RespiteLike many other reviewers, we stopped here after a day of travelling and found it quite welcoming as the staff spoke excellent English and were extremely helpful. The selection of food and beverages was excellent as was the facilities and the mood music. I would definitely recoomend stopping here even if you're not hungry but just want a pint of fine beer."
Positive,1,friendly servicewe dined here on our first night in France following a day of travelling and we chose The Frog from all the restaurants in Bercy village as the staff were very helpful especially when it came to choosing from the menu and translating some of the items.  There was a nice atmosphere and even though the Frog was very busy we didnt have to wait too long for our meal to arrive and the meal was very nice. We had fish; chicken salad; chicken bacon wraps.  All good
Positive,1,"Hot and Thirsty, have a pint here.After several hours of walking through the streets of East France, this pub is a welcome relief.  One of the best cheeseburgers in France."
Positive,1,"Good atmosphere ideal for familiesNice safe area , pedestrian only cobbled street with lots of hussle and bustle , food good , service ok but does get busy as a typical lively area. Is a safe bet with kids ."
Positive,1,"Nice atmosphere, Good food!Wen't in initially as it was one of the few restaurants with english menus! The food was amazing, we even went back a few days later for cocktails, happy birthday to me!"
Positive,1,"Evening Meal at The FrogAn attempt on an English Style pub.
Very good food they specalise in the 'Frog' beefburgers 100% beef. Very good and reasonable price.
If you are in a group and would like a beer, try their own brew Blonde. 22 euros a jug of 4 pints, savig 4 euros."
Positive,1,"Kicks Wetherspoons into touch!This is not your typical little French Bistro or Patisserie. It's more like the French version of Wetherspoons but with far better food and service. We are a family of two adults and two children and were accommodated straight away on a busy Saturday night in France. There is a lively and bustling ( but non intimidatory) atmosphere at The Frog and the service was completely excellent. The waiters and waitresses are extremely busy but always have time for you and are always smiling and polite. One dark haired waitress had the type of smile that super models would die for! We didn't have to wait long for food. We had 2 x nachos for starters - excellent, good to see them being served with jalapeños as well- and 4 x various burgers ( inc. veggie ) for main meals. Again, could not fault these either. Basically, had a very good night at The Frog.

Beers, excellent and there was a really good choice.

Don't expect Bistro type drinks or food as this, as mentioned earlier, is a French type of Wetherspoons. The main difference though is excellent waiters, better beers, better food , better clientele and a superior atmosphere. No rowdiness, bad language or obese underdressed hen party- goers. Funny how they can get it right in the continent? The place is huge yet we never felt crowded. If in Bercy Village then The Frog has to be a must try place. Highly recommended is The Frog. Thanks for a lovely and relaxing evening."
Positive,1,"What a wonderful pub in France!Nice, large-sized microbrewery restaurant. Nice selection of house beers. Staff are really friendly. Great food, great beer!"
Positive,1,"Nice beer in FranceI prefer beer to wine, so this little oasis was a great find.  The food comes in decent portions, and it's definitely pub-grub, rather than restaurant fare."
Positive,1,"Lovely dinner experience!The frog is in bercy village just in frot of the entrance to ketro station cour st.emilion... Lovely atmospere, frendly staff that speak english, home made beers of all kinds and cool selectiob of food. Service is really quick with some background music but not too lousld that u can have a conversation. I really do recommend it!"
Positive,1,"Good food Frog BercyGood pub food, not too expensive; good waitress - it's larger than you would think from outside. Bercy village was nice shopping and eating area."
Positive,1,"Excellent Food and ServiceWhilst staying in the Bercy Pullman for 3 nights, we went to the Frog Pub twice, the food was excellent and the service was very friendly and most of the staff speak good english. I was with my 2 year old and they gave him some crayons and paper to keep him entertained, which was great for me. The food was reasonably priced for France. I would definately go back to this pub."
Positive,1,"Innovative Pub off the beaten trackVery lovely pub in Bercy village, located in a former Train Station. The beer they are brewing on location is delicious and a pint costs a mere € 6.50 which is cheap in France."
Positive,1,"Fast Food with a FlairWe were delighted to find that our waiter spoke American English and helpfully described the menue.The place was quite noisy and crowded but service was fast and the food was good,especially the fish and french fries that I had. My husband enjoyed the Micro brewed beer that apparently is made in house..Prices are high by American standards but this is true all over France and they did take Visa."
Positive,1,"Hot FrogThe food is lovely, well the stuff we had was anyway (crispy chicken).  The beer brewed in the micro-brewery is also superb, but it was incredibly warm inside when we visited."
Positive,1,"Good bar for a few beersThe bar has a mix of its own brand lagers, which were a bit different. There was a ginger style one that I enjoyed! The bar has a young crowd, and was easily the busiest place in Bercy Village for a drink. I would check it out if you are in the area."

Negative,0,"This place lacks human decencyMy husband and I are in Rome for our honeymoon and read up on Ad Hoc thinking it would be a nice treat. I made the reservations online and was accepted instantly. We showed up last night at 8pm all dressed up for our reservation when the woman kept going to the back of the restaurant looking it up again while seating other people. The restaurant at this point was empty and stayed that way at least to 8:15pm. It turns out in human error on my part after visiting 3 cities in 10 days I made the reservation for tonight at 8pm instead of last night. They refused to seat us! I ask nicely telling them we are on our honeymoon and all they said was 'so sorry' and escorted us to the door as if we were trying to break in. There was no manager (that I was aware of in sight) as I can't imagine they'd let this behavoir take place. I would also like to add that it was about 85 degrees last night and this place has NO AIR CONDITIONING. A part of us were relieved to not have to eat in that smoltering heat.
After eating a very lovely meal up the street (there are tons of great places to choose from). My husband wanted to walk by Ad Hoc to see if they were 'completely booked'. Although they were more crowded they definitely could have accommodated us. We're from NYC and I honestly could never see this happening there regardless of who made the error. I'm sure this review won't affect anyones desire to try this place, but hopefully it will affect the way their staff treats people."
Negative,0,"Stay clear of this place!After a 10 day vacation in Italy we wanted to have a really special meal for the last evening (allthough I must admit our holiday was full of special meals...). Having passed the restaurant earlier in the afternoon my husband really liked the interior, and I liked that they had lobster w honeyglazed lemon on the menue, so we decided to eat there if they had a free table for us. Returning later in the evening we were greeted by a very friendly waitress and yes, they had room for us. Plenty of empty tables that evening actually (Sunday Nov. 7). Since we had been really overeating the whole trip, and I hadn´t read any reviews on this restaurant, we decided to just go for the ""secondi piatti"" and skip the antipasti. Well, good for us that we did. We did get the complementary sparkling white whine, and then went for the lobster on my part, and four try-out meat-courses for hubby.  I agree with others, the servings were really small, and our consolation in that respect was that we were in need of dieting anyway. Plates were cold, sucking the warmth out of the food. My lobster was pieces of lobster served on a square of cold, dry rice. Lobster was ok, as the strings of honey-glazed lemons. As a side order we had green asparagus with parmeggiano cheese; the asparagus wasn´t quite done so hard to chew, and the parmeggiano? Well, I am no expert, but it tasted like generic if there is such a thing when it comes to parmeggiano. Dry and tasteless! My husband's glass of wine was more like one fourth glass, and measured digitally, mind you! We wew served a basket of bread with the food without asking for it, and really didn´t touch it, but lo and behold: they charged us for the bread!!! Not even in the cheapest joint! But here, oh yes, and 3 € it was! By the time we were actually finished and served the bill by the ever-sweet waitress and noticed this we could only laugh! Thank God for speaking an unusual language (Swedish) and being able to laugh and comment on this experience at the spot.  The whole time a v ery unpleasant unsmiling man (the owner?) kept lurching in and out from the back of the restaurant. At one point one of teh waitresses seemed to try to cheer him up a bit by wrapping herself intimately around him in the back room behind our table (my seating position made it impossible for me not to notice), but to no avail. He remained very serous end stern. Everytime one of the waitresses received money from a guest he popped out to take it and check the bill, so strange, and it semed our waitress was a bit uncomfortable with this. If so eager, why didn´t he do the charging himself? All in all, a total flop for the prices they charge. There are so many other good restaurants in Rome, so do avoid this one !"
Negative,0,"Lots of fancy talk about their food and wines.All talk----no substance.Agree with all previous negative reviews.Arrived 6.20PM for6.30 reservation and told to WALK ROUND THE BLOCK FOR 10 TO 15 MINUTES. Had SEA TASTER MENU. All fancy talk but quantities MINUTE.Without being told I would not have known what Iwas 
eating in many cases.Put all courses together and might just fill a plate.BY THE WAY I am in my SEVENTIES and do not eat large courses but these were ridiculous."
Negative,0,"SHAMEFULIt was just a SHAME!

We waited for our starters for almost one hour! Just because they told us they were cutting by hand our Salumi, including Serrano Ham. I come from Spain, where, in quarter an hour you can have at least 6 traies of fresh-cut serrano ham!!! and when we told tthe waitress how slow they were she replied as if we where the guilty ones who had chosen that starter and knew how long it took it to prepare it! (on top of that the ham wasn`t even good)
Moreover it took us half an hour to have the bill!!
For God`s sake! I really encourage you not to go there!!!"
Negative,0,"disappointing - after reading such great reviewsI was in Rome this weekend and i had booked a table here 2 weeks prior to me arriving.
Their website stated that you would be welcomed with a glass of Prosecco (f.o.c), well we were not.
We were put at a table and left, then the waitress came back and asked if we would like some water. We were then left alone again.
While we were sat waiting for the menu and wine menu, we had an Italian couple come and sit next to us. Within seconds they had 2 glasses of Prosecco and all the menus they could ask for.
When the waitress returned she gave us our menu and said she would be back in 5, (we had been there for 20 mins) to take our order. At this point i decided not to stay and when the waitress returned i said could we pay for the water, and we were leaving.
When she asked why i stated that it was because i felt as if i had been treated like an idiot. Stating that thier website says they offer a free glass of Prosecco as a welcome gift, and we hadnt recieved one (when the couple on the next table did), she said that it was not a problem and offered to get us a glass, but that wasnt the point. I also said that we hadnt been given a menu for a while and i just felt that because i wasnt Italian that i was being treated unfairly ...... ( I happen to have proposed to my girlfriend earlier on in the day and was really looking forward to a lovely meal) which we did have elsewhere.
Sorry to be a bummer but i was gutted.."
Negative,0,Ad Hoc - yes some of the details of this restaurant are ad hocWe had a fab break in Rome for my 40th; the meal at Glass Hostaria was a highlight and we hoped for the same the following night at Ad Hoc as we'd read so many good reviews but it failed to reach our expectations. The maitre d'/sommelier seemed knowledgable and efficient but the dishes just did not deliver; I had the sea bass which had been taken off the bone badly so I was fishing out needle bones all through the meal and the nice potatoes they served with it were cold. My husband had a steak which was fine and a side order of fried potatoes which turned out to be frozen chips! We waited 40 minutes for the bill and I don't think for a bill of over £120 frozen anything is acceptable.
Negative,0,"“Ad hoc” rudeness!“Ad hoc” rudeness!!!
Terrible restaurant, rude and presumptuous staff!!! Poor food with portions of a starred restaurant even if it doesn't have any stars! Not recommended especially for foreign tourists!"
Negative,0,"How not to be disappointed?It was presented to us as one of the best Roman restaurants.
But had it not been for the setting, with so many beautiful bottles on the walls, and the kindness of the service, there was nothing but disappointment on the plate, whether it was the zucchini flowers with ricotta or the fresh pasta with summer truffles, tasteless and spoiled by the presence of useless grass. We will salute the Ornellaia which allowed us to dine on a more festive note."
Negative,0,"Overrated and touristyUnfortunately the food was just average. No dish was really convincing. The greeting from the kitchen was okay but not a highlight in terms of taste.

The tartare had a bland taste and relied on the fact that it was served with truffles. The artichoke stuffed with yarn didn't actually taste like anything.

The carbonara tasted good but was a bit too salty.

Unfortunately, the desserts were completely ill-thought out. I had mine returned too.

All dishes lack that certain something.

The wine list was great. Unfortunately the selection of open wines was not good."
Negative,0,"Bad tasting food difficult to digestWe didn't like the food that much.

The starters were tasteless

and hard to digest.

The pasta was nothing special.

The main course was cooked for too long.

The dessert was too creamy.

Overall, the food was nice to look at

but lacked finesse in terms of taste.

We didn't like the food at all and therefore had a restless night"
Negative,0,"Pretty dissappointing.I actually never write reviews for the restaurants, but for this one i just had to. The reason we decided to check this place out was only because of high ratings  on TA. I am still dissapointed about the choice we've made.Our dinner at this place was...well the right word for it would be BLAH... We have always dined at such wonderful places when visiting Rome before Ad Hoc. The atmosphere was very average and the way they seated people made it more uncomfortable. Do not even think to dress up for this one( even you think u r in Italy) it is very casual and reminded me of a coffee shop. I don't have anything bad to say about the service at our table, but nothing good either! They are really big on truffles on the menu, but that evening they were out of lots of things, so we did not have a lot to choose from.  The wine list is great tho. I did not see any managers on the floor, but the grumpy eastern European  looking man was very noticeable so as an owefully loud woman who was given the recipes to the guests next to us throughout our entire dinner. She was an employee or  my thought an owner and she was  really  loud to the point that I wanted to ask her to tune it down a little. Food was eatable and nothing to write home about till I got the cream brûlée. Instead of a nice and chilled on the inside and brown and crispy on the top I got Hot plate with Sprinckled  sugar on top.... My guess they just put it in the microwave instead of doing it the right way!!! Of course I didn't it touch it and we asked or the check. But no one even asked if something was wrong with it.  We did not complaint and just wanted to forget about an owefull experience , but the top position on TA list of restaurants in Rome is just making me sad again."
Negative,0,"SorryI'm afraid we were very let down by this restaurant.
We were left standing at the door for 5 minutes before being seated. We decided on the tasting menu for Land with wine. Although given a glass of prosecco when we were shown to our table, it took 35 minutes before we were served any food. 
Asparagus Roulade was overcooked.
Ravioli with Rabbit Ragout was very salty.
Ad Hoc Gnocchi were hard in the corners and I could have made a better sugo.
Saltimbocca alla Romana tasted like reconstituted meat in a roll.
Tiramisu was waterery and tasteless.
The service was fauning and pretentious.
Although I left alot on my plate uneaten I was never asked why until the dessert.
And finally as we were leaving we were given a cheap bottle of Spumante in a brown paper bag to take away. Why?
The only positive was that the wines were good.
All of this took almost 4 hours.
Would I recommend this restaurant? Absolutely not. Don't waste your time and money. There are far better places to eat in Rome."
Negative,0,"rotten starter - no apology. otherwise ok albeit overpriced10 of us ate on christmas day at Ad Hoc - we were seated in a seperate area which initally we thought would be good but ended up meaning we were ignored. One of our startes came and as we cut into the pasta dumping it was clear it was rotten (rotten fish is fairly easy to detect) we asked the waitress and she removed the plate without saying anything. our main courses came and they brought another of the starter, now without rotten crab inside but fairly empty because of it - still no apology. my aunt had eaten a piece before realising anything was wrong and was pretty upset about it.
the rest of the meal was ok but very expensive and the service continued to be pretty patchy. we werent offered anything off the bill or a dessert to say sorry - really disappointed"
Negative,0,"Overrated. Bad service.We walked in with a ressie to an empty restaurant, but for one couple. They jammed us in corner next to them, so we asked to move. She said she ""had to check""! It was absurd. They moved us begrudgingly, and we watched 3 couples get the same treatment. We did not like our food, and were disappointed."
Negative,0,"Very slow, average food, lack of wine, totally over-pricedVisited Ad Hoc for NYE with my husband and was very disappointed with the evening. It was a set menu with wine pairings for a set price of 190 Euros EACH. We arrived at 8pm and we're greeted with a small glass of prosecco, a nice touch but we then waited 1 hour for our starter and our first glass of wine. The starter was very average. We then waited 2 hours for our main and we we still hadn't had a wine refill so in the end we had to ask the waitress if we could purchase additional wine. The waitress gave us a refill but the fact we had to ask and had had 1 glass of prosecco and 1 glass of wine in 3 hours was just not good enough. The two couples next to us also asked for more wine.  One lady was literally falling asleep at the table. Two other couples were ordering espresso which we assumed was to help them to stay awake.  The main was again very average and cold. The 'sea' menu was mainly just deep fried fish and sea food. We complained again about the time it was taking and the fact that we had been without wine for a further 30 minutes (at least).  The atmosphere was awful and very flat as everyone was so frustrated and had only had 3 glasses of wine all evening so the New Year came and went without many people noticing. The couple next to us were still waiting to be served their main meal after midnight.  We had to complain twice about the time it was taking and the lack of wine which ruined the evening completely as we are not the complaining types. Overall the service was average and very, very slow, at 380 Euros for two it was completely and utterly over priced as the food at best was very average.  We believe the Ad Hoc tasting menu with wine is normally 70 Euros and I think hiking the price up to 190 Euros per person was a mistake as the food, service did not live up to the price. We have eaten at many nice restaurants and would have expected a lot more for a NYE meal for the price they charged. We wish we had popped into a local Trattoria and enjoyed the fireworks and atmosphere in the Pizazza del Popolo. Incidentally, we had planned to watch the fireworks in the Piazza del Popolo but missed them due to the fact that the meal in the end took 5 hours! A very, very disappointing evening."
Negative,0,"Poor serviceI can't comment on the food but the service was below par. We didn't have a reservation but it was still on the early side of dinner time. The restaurant had plenty of open tables however we were told they were full. When we asked about a reservation the next night we were told they were full for the next 2 nights, all this without looking at a reservation log book.
Needless to say we didn't try to dine here again."
Negative,0,"Unfortunately disappointingWe reserved a table through the website. This was very comfortable. We received a receipt. The atmorphere of the restaurant is very nice. The waitresses are very friendly, too. But it took very long until we could order. The gave us a complementary glas of prosecco. Overall the food was not really good except for the fettucine with truffels. The main course with meat was not good at all. We returned it to the kitchen. Overall the meal took 3.5 hours which was a lot of waiting. The restaurant was far too expensive for the value. After all the nice food we had in Rome in the small simple restaurants I would not go there again."
Negative,0,"Rude and inflexibleWe had a reservation for 4 people, but was joined by a 5th at the last minute. As this was a child we hoped this would not be a problem. This couldn't have been further from the truth. 

The lady that dealt with us could not have been less helpful, in fact she was bordering on rude and aggressive. If our request for an extra chair at the end of a table for 4 was so difficult for a restaurant to handle, fair enough, but at least decline our request in a polite, professional manner... Sadly not the case at Ad Hoc."
Negative,0,"Absolutely not best in Rome - Would not returnWith much anticipation we arrived for our reservation.  We were promptly seated, but then the trouble started.  It took nearly an hour for our order to be taken.  Sadly they were out of many menu items, including some featured in the hailed tasting menus.  Our dinner took nearly 4 hours with painfully slow service and most of the time with empty water and wine glasses.  Servers were completely inattentive.  I sensed that the entire dining room was annoyed with the poor service.  Food was OK, but several items on our tasting menu were cold and inedible.  Please save yourself the time and money.  There is absolutely no way that this is the best place in Rome."
Negative,0,"Expected the TA rating's and I was disapointedWalked in and didn't get in, so made a reservation, confirmed thru e-mail. Arrived on time and they made us feel unwelcomed likethere was no reservation an after all they gave us a terrible table. Next to the waiters station. (never accept that table). They where out of squid and truffle as a welcome. But surprise 50% of the menu had truffle. I asked for help with the wine list. And never got help from the maitre'd and even approached our table. Would never go back."
Negative,0,"expensive rubbishit took nearly 5 hours for them to complete our meal. They forgot to process our main course!!! Even our coffee took 30mins to arrive. What did they do go to brazil to pick the beans themselves. All this cost us 228€ for 2 of us. The food when it did arrive was average. Not to be recommended, look for where the locals go because it's not here!"
Negative,0,"A boring four and a half hours that could have been superbWe arrived at 08.15 with table booked for 08.30. No problem, made to feel very welcome. Problems started after first course.... I do not think the kitchen was able to cope with the meal orders..... seriously it took them four and a half hours to serve us our meal. The waitresses kept on apologising saying 'would not be long', 'working on yours now', 'yours is next to be cooked', etc.......
I think this is about the only restaurant I have left without leaving a tip.
It could have been superb if the kitchen timing was sorted, but the speed of non service spolit everything."
Negative,0,"How can this be the no. 1 restaurant in Rome ???There wasn't one Italian person in this place. Only tourist, who like ourselves, read the reviews on tripadvisor and decided to venture there.
While the service was kind (but as the crowd, not local), the food was over trying and disappointing. Nothing close to the traditionally simple and qualitative cuisine you expect in Italy. 
DON'T GO THERE !!!"

The dessert was too creamy.

Overall, the food was nice to look at

but lacked finesse in terms of taste.

We didn't like the food at all and therefore had a restless night"
Negative,0,"Pretty dissappointing.I actually never write reviews for the restaurants, but for this one i just had to. The reason we decided to check this place out was only because of high ratings  on TA. I am still dissapointed about the choice we've made.Our dinner at this place was...well the right word for it would be BLAH... We have always dined at such wonderful places when visiting Rome before Ad Hoc. The atmosphere was very average and the way they seated people made it more uncomfortable. Do not even think to dress up for this one( even you think u r in Italy) it is very casual and reminded me of a coffee shop. I don't have anything bad to say about the service at our table, but nothing good either! They are really big on truffles on the menu, but that evening they were out of lots of things, so we did not have a lot to choose from.  The wine list is great tho. I did not see any managers on the floor, but the grumpy eastern European  looking man was very noticeable so as an owefully loud woman who was given the recipes to the guests next to us throughout our entire dinner. She was an employee or  my thought an owner and she was  really  loud to the point that I wanted to ask her to tune it down a little. Food was eatable and nothing to write home about till I got the cream brûlée. Instead of a nice and chilled on the inside and brown and crispy on the top I got Hot plate with Sprinckled  sugar on top.... My guess they just put it in the microwave instead of doing it the right way!!! Of course I didn't it touch it and we asked or the check. But no one even asked if something was wrong with it.  We did not complaint and just wanted to forget about an owefull experience , but the top position on TA list of restaurants in Rome is just making me sad again."
Negative,0,"SorryI'm afraid we were very let down by this restaurant.
We were left standing at the door for 5 minutes before being seated. We decided on the tasting menu for Land with wine. Although given a glass of prosecco when we were shown to our table, it took 35 minutes before we were served any food. 
Asparagus Roulade was overcooked.
Ravioli with Rabbit Ragout was very salty.
Ad Hoc Gnocchi were hard in the corners and I could have made a better sugo.
Saltimbocca alla Romana tasted like reconstituted meat in a roll.
Tiramisu was waterery and tasteless.
The service was fauning and pretentious.
Although I left alot on my plate uneaten I was never asked why until the dessert.
And finally as we were leaving we were given a cheap bottle of Spumante in a brown paper bag to take away. Why?
The only positive was that the wines were good.
All of this took almost 4 hours.
Would I recommend this restaurant? Absolutely not. Don't waste your time and money. There are far better places to eat in Rome."
Negative,0,"rotten starter - no apology. otherwise ok albeit overpriced10 of us ate on christmas day at Ad Hoc - we were seated in a seperate area which initally we thought would be good but ended up meaning we were ignored. One of our startes came and as we cut into the pasta dumping it was clear it was rotten (rotten fish is fairly easy to detect) we asked the waitress and she removed the plate without saying anything. our main courses came and they brought another of the starter, now without rotten crab inside but fairly empty because of it - still no apology. my aunt had eaten a piece before realising anything was wrong and was pretty upset about it.
the rest of the meal was ok but very expensive and the service continued to be pretty patchy. we werent offered anything off the bill or a dessert to say sorry - really disappointed"
Negative,0,"Overrated. Bad service.We walked in with a ressie to an empty restaurant, but for one couple. They jammed us in corner next to them, so we asked to move. She said she ""had to check""! It was absurd. They moved us begrudgingly, and we watched 3 couples get the same treatment. We did not like our food, and were disappointed."
Negative,0,"Very slow, average food, lack of wine, totally over-pricedVisited Ad Hoc for NYE with my husband and was very disappointed with the evening. It was a set menu with wine pairings for a set price of 190 Euros EACH. We arrived at 8pm and we're greeted with a small glass of prosecco, a nice touch but we then waited 1 hour for our starter and our first glass of wine. The starter was very average. We then waited 2 hours for our main and we we still hadn't had a wine refill so in the end we had to ask the waitress if we could purchase additional wine. The waitress gave us a refill but the fact we had to ask and had had 1 glass of prosecco and 1 glass of wine in 3 hours was just not good enough. The two couples next to us also asked for more wine.  One lady was literally falling asleep at the table. Two other couples were ordering espresso which we assumed was to help them to stay awake.  The main was again very average and cold. The 'sea' menu was mainly just deep fried fish and sea food. We complained again about the time it was taking and the fact that we had been without wine for a further 30 minutes (at least).  The atmosphere was awful and very flat as everyone was so frustrated and had only had 3 glasses of wine all evening so the New Year came and went without many people noticing. The couple next to us were still waiting to be served their main meal after midnight.  We had to complain twice about the time it was taking and the lack of wine which ruined the evening completely as we are not the complaining types. Overall the service was average and very, very slow, at 380 Euros for two it was completely and utterly over priced as the food at best was very average.  We believe the Ad Hoc tasting menu with wine is normally 70 Euros and I think hiking the price up to 190 Euros per person was a mistake as the food, service did not live up to the price. We have eaten at many nice restaurants and would have expected a lot more for a NYE meal for the price they charged. We wish we had popped into a local Trattoria and enjoyed the fireworks and atmosphere in the Pizazza del Popolo. Incidentally, we had planned to watch the fireworks in the Piazza del Popolo but missed them due to the fact that the meal in the end took 5 hours! A very, very disappointing evening."
Negative,0,"Poor serviceI can't comment on the food but the service was below par. We didn't have a reservation but it was still on the early side of dinner time. The restaurant had plenty of open tables however we were told they were full. When we asked about a reservation the next night we were told they were full for the next 2 nights, all this without looking at a reservation log book.
Needless to say we didn't try to dine here again."
Negative,0,"Unfortunately disappointingWe reserved a table through the website. This was very comfortable. We received a receipt. The atmorphere of the restaurant is very nice. The waitresses are very friendly, too. But it took very long until we could order. The gave us a complementary glas of prosecco. Overall the food was not really good except for the fettucine with truffels. The main course with meat was not good at all. We returned it to the kitchen. Overall the meal took 3.5 hours which was a lot of waiting. The restaurant was far too expensive for the value. After all the nice food we had in Rome in the small simple restaurants I would not go there again."
Negative,0,"Rude and inflexibleWe had a reservation for 4 people, but was joined by a 5th at the last minute. As this was a child we hoped this would not be a problem. This couldn't have been further from the truth. 

The lady that dealt with us could not have been less helpful, in fact she was bordering on rude and aggressive. If our request for an extra chair at the end of a table for 4 was so difficult for a restaurant to handle, fair enough, but at least decline our request in a polite, professional manner... Sadly not the case at Ad Hoc."
Negative,0,"Absolutely not best in Rome - Would not returnWith much anticipation we arrived for our reservation.  We were promptly seated, but then the trouble started.  It took nearly an hour for our order to be taken.  Sadly they were out of many menu items, including some featured in the hailed tasting menus.  Our dinner took nearly 4 hours with painfully slow service and most of the time with empty water and wine glasses.  Servers were completely inattentive.  I sensed that the entire dining room was annoyed with the poor service.  Food was OK, but several items on our tasting menu were cold and inedible.  Please save yourself the time and money.  There is absolutely no way that this is the best place in Rome."
Negative,0,"Expected the TA rating's and I was disapointedWalked in and didn't get in, so made a reservation, confirmed thru e-mail. Arrived on time and they made us feel unwelcomed likethere was no reservation an after all they gave us a terrible table. Next to the waiters station. (never accept that table). They where out of squid and truffle as a welcome. But surprise 50% of the menu had truffle. I asked for help with the wine list. And never got help from the maitre'd and even approached our table. Would never go back."
Negative,0,"expensive rubbishit took nearly 5 hours for them to complete our meal. They forgot to process our main course!!! Even our coffee took 30mins to arrive. What did they do go to brazil to pick the beans themselves. All this cost us 228€ for 2 of us. The food when it did arrive was average. Not to be recommended, look for where the locals go because it's not here!"
Negative,0,"A boring four and a half hours that could have been superbWe arrived at 08.15 with table booked for 08.30. No problem, made to feel very welcome. Problems started after first course.... I do not think the kitchen was able to cope with the meal orders..... seriously it took them four and a half hours to serve us our meal. The waitresses kept on apologising saying 'would not be long', 'working on yours now', 'yours is next to be cooked', etc.......
I think this is about the only restaurant I have left without leaving a tip.
It could have been superb if the kitchen timing was sorted, but the speed of non service spolit everything."
Negative,0,"How can this be the no. 1 restaurant in Rome ???There wasn't one Italian person in this place. Only tourist, who like ourselves, read the reviews on tripadvisor and decided to venture there.
While the service was kind (but as the crowd, not local), the food was over trying and disappointing. Nothing close to the traditionally simple and qualitative cuisine you expect in Italy. 
DON'T GO THERE !!!"
Negative,0,"lost the touchWe went there for all the good critics here in tripadvisor, but sadly service was terrible and ambience was boring and 1 hour to serve the appetaizer and one more for the entre. food was ok and the waitress try to be nice but not enough. wouldn´t repit."
Negative,0,TERRIBLE ATTITUDE!!!!DONT GO!!!!Terrible attitude as soon as walked in!!! Who do they think they are???
Positive,1,Birthday DinnerAd Hoc was the PERFECT place to celebrate my birthday. They made the entire dining experience so special and continued to bring out special treats throughout the meal. The entire waitstaff was attentive and made us feel at home. Their wine list is extensive and the staff was fantastic at narrowing down and helping us find a wine we could all enjoy. Would highly recommend the dining experience here for anyone looking for an incredible meal in Rome.
Positive,1,"Great Italian cooking with a touchIt was the second time I ate at Ad Hoc, after a few years. Food is still great, Italian with a modern touch. Good and friendly service. Huge selection of good wines.
The place is cosy enough for a romantic dinner or a small group appreciating clever cooking."
Positive,1,"One of the best meals in ItalyYou want to be treated like royalty while paying for normal fine dining? This is the place. And the food is wonderful. Lots of complimentary small bites to make this worthy of a Michelin star. Seriously, give this place a try. I think you will love the whole experience."
Positive,1,"PhenomenalI could not recommend this restaurant more. I spent one month in Rome and this was HANDS DOWN the best food I had the entire time I was there. The atmosphere was 10/10, a candlelit, romantic setting, which from my experience was quite rare in the brightly lit Italian restaurants. Having said that the main highlight was the food which was exceptional even by Italian standards. Also the staff were wonderful and they even sent a cookbook of recipes, truffle and wine information. I was just blown away with the experience and could not recommend it more to locals and tourist alike"
Positive,1,Great food and serviceThe food was good. The wine selection and service were excellent. The restaurant is very cute with a warm and cozy feel to it.
Positive,1,"Excellent atmosphere and service!If you want to really enjoy in food and service I highly reccomend Ad Hoc restaurant. Outsanding service, great wine list, great starters and pasta with white or black truffles. Lamb as a main course was excellent and also the desserts. At the end they have a present for every guest, small bottle of extra vergin olive oil. Very nice gesture!"
Positive,1,"wonderful  & accomodatingwe showed up on a Saturday night without a reservation, but a late cancellation proved fortuitous.   My wife and I took our daughter and wanted to give her a special night before she started her school.  Though we ate only a few courses off the ala carte menu, the staff did a wonderful job and made my daughter feel special including a gift of a some olive oil at the end of the night.   A wine substitution of an out of stock bottle was spot on and the service was impeccable. 
Wonderful"
Positive,1,Very tasty!!!Highly recommend this place. Pasta with truffles is incredible! Wine list is in two books! Starters are great!!!
Positive,1,"Great food, excellent wine, inviting atmosphere &  outstanding serviceIf you want a restaurant experience that captures all of the good things about Italy in general and Rome in particular you must visit Ad Hoc. The restautant surrounds you with fine food and wine on the shelves while the service is efficient but unhurried. However, the highlight, as in any good restaurant, is the food and wine you are served. Simply exceptional."
Positive,1,Michelin must come for a visitFantastic food and wine. Exellent service. The atmosphere were calm and quiet. Tidy and clean restrooms.
Positive,1,"Excellent food , wine and serviceLast night in Rome , we wanted a special meal and certainly got one at ad hoc . We had the tasting menus with wine.  All great food, lovely fresh bread, we thoroughly enjoyed all of the courses and the service and ambience was very good. Lovely not to be rushed at all, great evening.  Highly recommend"
Positive,1,"Should have a Michelin StarService , Friendliness , Food. Selection , and Standard All 5 Star 
Try for a special occasion.  
Nice touches. Amuse Bouchée, Home made cookies and little bottles of olive oil
As gifts.    So good !"
Positive,1,"Birthday DinnerWe dropped in on a Saturday evening and got a table even though we had not reserved and it was very busy, We had the tasting menu which was delicious and wines excellent.  Service was very friendly and efficiant and overall a faboulus experience during our weekend in Rome at the end of November."
Positive,1,"Wonderful restaurant with great wine listAs Hoc is conveniently located not far from the Piazza del Popolo and Piazza di Spagna.  We had the Truffle set menu and the meat set menu, paired with wines. The sommelier was knowledgeable and explained what we were drinking.  The service was good but uneven, as at times the food arrived and then we had to wait for the wine.  The suckling pig and beef cheeks were rich and delicious.  The meal included an amuse bouche as well as three desserts and, finally, a gift of a small bottle of olive oil as we left.  A wonderful experience!"
Positive,1,"Tried to book this restaurant for New Year’s EveTried to book this restaurant for New Year’s Eve unfortunately it was booked out which tells a story.    We had been having a relaxing day after New Year’s Eve celebrations we decided about 8pm to go for a walk and we stumbled across the restaurant by accident.  So we decided to go in how lucky we were we got the last table.  This restaurant is a well oiled machine they start you off with a small glass of wine and aperitifs lovely touch 
We both started with anti pasta dishes octopus pasta and cubed carbonara both were delicious and well presented 
For our mains we decided to go for suckling pig and fillet of beef we weren’t disappointed both dishes were delicious 
I’ve got to mention the lovely young lady sommelier who chose a lovely wine to compliment our meal.    We looked at the sweet menu and on another day we would have sampled something but we were both full l finished with a cappuccino and we were presented with a lovely mixture of small petit fours which was lovely 
There’s a cracking chef in this establishment with a great team round about him keep up the good work guys 10 out of 10 if your in Rome don’t leave without trying this restaurant a culinary experience"
Positive,1,"Fantastic experience!The restaurant atmosphere was relaxing and beautiful. The food was amazing. I highly recommend the wine and truffle tasting menu. When it came time for dessert, we had a pre-dessert, dessert, and a post-dessert. They gave us a small bottle of olive oil to take with us. Later, they sent a thank you email with a cookbook attached. Fantastic experience!"
Positive,1,"Delicious food! Highly recommend!We celebrated my 50th birthday here and it was a great choice!!!
The food is amazing, so delicious.  And portion sizes are big, so be warned!!! We really struggled to finish it, and that was after she recommended I just have a half size portion of the pasta!! My carbonara three ways was the best carbonara I’ve ever had!!!! Presentation is amazing, and lots of nice touches like the amuse-bouche and their own breads and petit fours.
The wine list is the best I’ve ever seen!! So much choice. 
Service is excellent, friendly and efficient. They made it a special night for me by bringing out a cake at the end and singing Happy Birthday to me!! 
When we’re back in Rome, we’ll definitely be eating here again!"
Positive,1,"DinnerAd Hoc,
Wonderful place.
The food is amazing.
A lot of option.. All is good and tasty.
Don't miss the ""taste dinner"" really unique and delicious."
Positive,1,"AtmosphericNice and cozy place just behind piazza del Popolo. Excellent service and really nice food with great selection of the first materials. 

The extra virgin olive oil made the difference and was surprisingly offered as a gift at the end of our meal. 
Totally recommend it for couples or special occasions.

The most important was the fact that there wasn’t a hurry to leave the table so as to replace you with other clients. They gave you time to decide and enjoy your meal. 

An atmospheric experience in the heart of Rome"
Positive,1,"Very GoodWe always eat here every time we go to Rome. You really need a reservation. It isn’t as good as it use to be, but still one of our favorites"
Positive,1,"Birthday TreatWent to Adhoc as a treat for my wifes surprise birthday trip to Rome. 
Upon arrival we received a very warm and friendly greeting from the staff. 
After a glass of fizz, we decided on a land taster menu with an amended desert and also a change to the wine (my wife doesnt enjoy red wine) and the black truffle taster menu with wine. 
The food was simply sublime every course a culinary treat for us both. 
Also received an amuse bouche and also a pre desert treat as well as petit fours!
The staff also Surprised my wife with a rendition of happy birthday as well much to her surprise. 
The staff couldn't have been better simply impeccable service and food. They couldn't do enough to help us, answer any of our questions or accommodate our requests. 
The venue is wonderful, very atmospheric and the perfect setting for a wonderful meal. 
We left with very full bellys and very satisfied by our experience. 
Would definitely come again."
Positive,1,"4.5 to be fairAs you walk in you immediately notice hundreds of wine bottles around the walls, some fixed to the walls and some loose. At first it appears to be a cosy little restaurant but it's bigger than you think. Just after 8 it suddenly filled and not a single table remained empty. Not bad on a street which was full of nothing but restaurants. The general ambience was lovely,  buzzing conversation and nice lighting.  The staff were really friendly and even though busy, took the time to chat. Free glass of prosecco on arrival and a plate of petit fours at the end. The food itself was well cooked and presented.  I can highly recommend the cod starter. We shared a lobster spaghetti which was served up in 2 smaller portions and they allow you to have a couple of small portion mains like a tasting menu.  I had the beef fillet and the suckling pig. Both delicious. We marked down a bit because the Mrs had 2 dishes which were a bit dry and needed a sauce of some kind to make it more enjoyable.  Though we did put this on the feedback card they provided at the end. So a good 4.5 out of 5 and we would certainly recommend and return."
Positive,1,"Excellent restaurant in RomeGreat atmosphere, good staff and divine food. We had the a fantastic 4 course dinner and the food is to die for!"
Positive,1,"Dinner with my familyI read about Ad Hoc on the internet, since I was at Rome with my family on my birthday and I was trying to find a nice restaurant to go. We went there, but since I had no reservation, I couldn't do it. However, we really liked what we saw, so we booked a table for the day after and we are very glad we did it.
That was an emazing night. We were surprised by the great service and an even better food and wine experience. 
We spent 16 days travelling around Italy, mainly in Toscana, tasting all kind of italian dishes. However, the Ad Hoc night was our better food experience during the entire trip."
Positive,1,"Very good experienceVery good restaurant, good atmosphere, the menu is based on seasonal products and a lot of truffles and an impressive wine card"
Positive,1,"So lucky to find this in RomeOne word “Excellent”. The tasting menu, which was white and black truffle based was astounding. The all women front of house knew their menus and wines.. what a selection. I hope that Thomas Keller, whom Chef Paul Bocuse on behalf-of French President Nicolas Sarkozy, presented to Keller as a Chevalier of The French Legion of Honor in 2011 in recognition of his lifelong commitment to the traditions of French cuisine and his role in elevating cooking in America; will open in London."
Positive,1,"Fantastic BirthdayFor My wife's birthday in Rome I decided to make a reservation at Ad Hoc.  We are so glad we did. From the first greeting, the servers (who actually put a candle in my wife's dessert and sang Happy Birthday to her), to the cheerful good bye the service was 5 star.  We had two different tasting menus - both delicious.  The execution of each dish was perfect.  The wine pairings were spot on.  If you find yourself in Rome you should absolutely go to Ad Hoc for a great experience."
Positive,1,"Amazing RestaurantWe visit Rome every year and we were recommended this restaurant 3 years ago but unfortunately was always fully booked ! So we booked well in advance for our visit this year, we were not disappointed at all and can see why always busy. From the moment we walked through the door our evening was perfect from the atmosphere to the staff and of course the absolutely fantastic food. We loved it so much we are returning for New Years Eve and cannot wait 😊"
Positive,1,Amazing engagement dinner!Amazing engagement dinner! Absolutely loved the Land tasting menu with wine pairing. The hostess was very informative and gave great introductions to the food and wine before each course.
Positive,1,"A real ""Gem""What a gorgeous venue. The room, ambiance, menu and wine list are exceptional. Make sure you book as it is more often than not booked out. The complimentary glass of prosecco and appetiser was a really treat also. If you love Truffles then you'll love this place. Our only complaint was that we were trying to enjoy the calm and unique ambiance and the staff were all talking amongst themselves around us and it was off putting."
Positive,1,"Amazing Culinary Experience!We visited Rome for my husband’s birthday.  Food was excellent, carbonara trio and spaghetti with lobster a “must have”.  Extensive wine list, but the staff did a great job assisting with selection.  Nice atmosphere, book reservation early.  We look forward to visiting Ad Hoc on our next trip to Rome!!"
Positive,1,Wonderful mealThis was our fifth visit to Rome and Ad Hoc and it never lets us down. Two of us had the tasting menu and two picked from the Al a Carte menu. Most restaurants don’t allow this but it was no problem to Ad Hoc. All the meals were superb. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. The wine list is amazing. Loved our visit.
Positive,1,"Charming Atmosphere and Superb FoodMy fiancé and I went to Ad Hoc on the recommendation of a friend. We were given a call ahead of time, letting us know that the electricity was out but they would still be able to accommodate us. We arrived to a cavernous but cozy room aglow with candles. Our waiter was apologetic, but it was the most beautiful sight. The service was fantastic and the food was other worldly. We loved it so much. It was our favorite restaurant out of our week in Italy and we traveled to Rome and the Amalfi coast."
Positive,1,"AnniversaryWent there for our anniversary on 13 November, food was excellent, the service was very good also the staff were very knowledgeable 
Very extensive wine list, we were made very welcome and were given a little gift of some olive oil at the end of our meal, would highly recommended this restaurant if you’re visiting Rome"
Positive,1,Outstanding truffle tasting menuexcellent truffle tasting menu and they were very flexible with options.  First night we were in Rome and they set a great tone for service and quality
Positive,1,"Memorable dining experienceMy wife and I had for most delicious tasting menu ever. Every dish was excellent. The dining room was quiet, relaxed and intimate. The perfect setting for an evening of great food and wine. We can't wait until we return to Rome and Ad Hoc."
Positive,1,"ROMAN TastingWe did a lot of research before choosing our hotel and restaurants for a three night Roman holiday.  Ad Hoc was out choice for the first night in Rome.  We walked to the restaurant from Babuino 181 hotel.  A short walk in a good area.

We arrived a bit early but they seated us immediately without a problem.  The restaurant is small, perhaps intimate is a better description but the table spacing and layout give each party ample privacy.  The decor is nice too.  It is essentially a wine cellar atmosphere with the restaurants wine selection surrounding the room on shelves with led lights.  

We ordered the Roman style cuisine tasting menu with the corresponding wine offer.  I though we would be selecting one item from each course but the menu includes everything.  We really enjoyed all of the food and all of the wine with one exception.  The dessert wine was not to our liking, but that was the only issue in an otherwise excellent meal.  

The service was excellent.  We would go back again and we have no issue to recommend the restaurant."
Positive,1,Great tasting menuWe went here fir the tasting menus and were not disappointed.  I had the Roman menu and my wife had the land menu all with wine pairings.  The meal starts with a welcome amuse bouche and sparkling wine.  There was also s pre and post dessert.  All of the courses were fantastic.  Our best meal in Rome.
Positive,1,"Amazing food and wine!This is a great restaurant with great service, we thoroughly enjoyed everything! Definitely one of the more memorable dinners we had in Italy!"
Positive,1,"FabulousAn absolute must to visit this restaurant whilst your in Rome.
The staff we're friendly and knew everything about the food they were serving, the atmosphere was relaxed and was just lovely. I celebrated my 50th birthday here with my husband and enjoyed every moment here, they even got the whole restaurant singing happy Birthday!!"
Positive,1,"All around amazingWe had our anniversary dinner at the Ad Hoc restaurant, and enjoyed the truffles tasting menu paired with wines.  The food was great, rivaling some of the best fine dining restaurants we've visited. Better yet, it was very reasonably priced at 125 euros per person including wine. The atmosphere is cozy and service personable and attentive. At the end of the dinner we we were presented with a special anniversary bottle of prosecco and an Ad Hoc labeled bottle of olive oil. 
The lovely experience continued after we returned home, with a mini restaurant e-cookbook arriving via email a few weeks after our visit. 
Highly recommend and definitely will return to this restaurant on our next visit to Rome."
Positive,1,"Six Stars if PossibleThis is absolutely one of the best meals I've had in Rome.  From start to finish, each dish had wonderful flavor, and had unique style.  Service was exceptional, and presentation was as well.  The pumpkin blossoms and roulade in phyllo dough were great starters.  The special was a cake of veal and lamb that was simply outstanding, as was the sea bass and spaghetti.  They have a variety of truffles that can be added to any dish, which makes it a very unique experience.  The banana gelato was a perfect end to the meal as well!"
Positive,1,"Superb Ambience and tasting menuWe booked this in advance for my birthday meal.  Upon arrival we were shown to the nicest table in the house for 4 people which us slightly elevated surrounded on 3 sides by vintage bottles of red wine.  The lighting is perfect.

The truffle tasting menu paired with wines was perfect and I must say the portion sizes were generous!  I'm not an expert on truffles, but the food was of a high quality and well prepared.

After the meal we were presented with 2 bottles of Prosecco and some olive oil which was a nice touch.  The meal was good value as well for 4 people, recommneded. Perfecto!"
Positive,1,"Amazing meal and experienceOur visit to Ad Hoc in September 2019 while in Rome looking for an apartment was one of the most pleasant and satisfying dining experiences we have had on our many trips there. The food was spot on, the service and staff outstanding.

This establishement compares favorably to many 2 to 3 Michelin starred restaurants we have visited."
Positive,1,MysigtVery cozy restaurant with a great atmosphere! One of the waitresses were great and the rest of them OK. Food was good but I think we had even higher hopes! But it was absolutely worth the visit!
Positive,1,"One of the best restaurants I’ve ever been toGreat atmosphere, service and menu. What more can you ask for? The place looks expensive and cosy at the same time, so you don’t feel uncomfortable. The service is great, the waiters know the menu perfectly and make good recommendations. The wine list is the best I’ve ever seen. More than 200 pages, I think, of high quality Italian wine. And the restaurant specialises in truffles. They have tasting menus and special truffle menu from which we ordered. Everything was amazing!"
Positive,1,A Pure Delight!A highlight of our 10 days in Rome.  Fine Dining at its best.  Terrific staff. Remarkable wine list is sure to please.
Positive,1,"Best Meal in RomeMy wife, daughter and I had a wonderful meal at Ad Hoc.  A friend recommended the resturant, and it certainly lived up to the recommendation.  When we went, the resturant had a special truffle menu — which we all ordered from.  It was simply delicious!  Even better — when we mentioned to the manager we were looking for a good resturant for cacio a pepe — it was not on the menu — she went to the kitchen and whipped up an order.  It was amazingly good.  Although we were stuffed, we topped it off with a special chocolate dessert.  As to wine, we let the sommelier pick for us and she did an outstanding job.  When in Rome .. eat at Ad Hoc!"
Positive,1,"Superb!We liked everything about it: the food & wine, the understated elegance, the service. 
We indulged in some white truffles, currently in season. The sommelier was up to par, especially since Italian wines are not my strong suit. 
Reserve early, this restaurant is in high demand."
Positive,1,"Spectacular...The treatment, dinner, wines, desserts, the atmosphere .... this restaurant is incredibly good. Without a doubt, if we return to Rome, Ad Hoc is a must. Thanks for everything. An unforgettable dinner in a very cool place. Greetings and thanks to the entire Ad Hoc team."
Positive,1,"More than Ad Hoc - a memory to keepBehind the via Corso and hidden away.... at least when you work in the dark evening in Rome we found Ad Hoc reataurant - well received and settled the fun started. First impression a place that know it’s wine,
Food and what customer experience should be ! A menu of good ckassics but well known for the truffle .... and what a tartar with mixed truffles supplied by recommended Pinot Noir from Haas ! Great mains and deserts served with a smile and small discussions - a memorable evening that will be repeated ! Thanks to the chef,
waiters at Ad Hoc 🍾🙏🏼"
Positive,1,"WHAT A TREATMy husband made our anniversary dinner reservations before we left the USA by reading past TripAdisor reviews.  This is a small, but wonderful restaurant.  A fresh rose was on our reserved table, and the food and wine were outstanding as was the top notch service. They called for a taxi when we were ready to leave because in Rome taxi's don't cruise like NYC.  A wonderful, memorable night."
Positive,1,"Simply OutstandingI booked online as it was our anniversary, the food was fantastic along with the service. The staff had a wealth of knowledge about the food and wines, I will be going back.

To my surprise the bill should have been 170 Euro bu because I booked online, the gave me 10percent off. Paying 160 Euro for 7 course fine dining restaurant is very reasonable especially in Rome, I would highly recommended."
Positive,1,"Required when in RomeWe always go to Ad Hoc in Rome. The food is creative and delicious. The wine selection is fabulous! The staff is very attentive and have great knowledge of the wines.
We had a selection of appetizers which included a deconstructed zucchini flower.
The entrees were excellent. I had fish which was wonderful and my husband had beef from Tuscany.
If you are a truffle fan...this is the place!"
Positive,1,"The best in Roma!This is a tradition. The last 4 times we have visited Rome, we always dine at Ad Hoc on  our night last. They are consistently excellent. 
From the starters and their unbelievable pasta to the main courses, everything is terrific.
And the service is perfecto! 
See you again very soon. Hopefully I won't spill my wine on my wife's white pants. 
Grazie.

Positive,1,"A little bit of quiet in Roma!Fabulous meal, great service and a beautiful dining room - had an excellent meal at Ad Hoc on a hot night in July - we will be back!"
Positive,1,"Highly recommend this fantastic restaurantI booked Ad Hoc after reading some positive reviews and some reviews referring to birthday meals. We were in Rome for a wedding but it coincided with my girlfriend's birthday so I was on the look out for a good restaurant for that night. Booking from the UK was easy and the communication was good, I was e-mailed asking if I want to pre-order a dessert as I had mentioned it was for my girlfriend's birthday. The day before the booking I received a call to confirm and when we arrived we were warmly welcomed and taken to our seat, which seemed to be the best table in the restaurant in my opinion, and we had a complimentary glass of sparkling wine each. Our host and all the waitresses were absolutely brilliant, so attentive and really knew the menu inside out. When each dish was brought out we were given detailed descriptions. We were given a complimentary starter which was delicious and we all ordered something different, so the sommelier helped us pair a good wine to the dishes. All the courses were incredible, for me the Pasta with truffles was brilliant, this was a starter on the night, and the Suckling pig was so nice. At the end of the meal the lights went out and the waitresses sang happy birthday to my girlfriend and brought out the tiramisu that I pre-ordered. After the dessert we got yet another complimentary dessert selection of home made biscuits and then just before we left a bottle of Ad Hoc's olive oil, which we had during our starter and loved, so this was a lovely touch. 

Overall unbelievably brilliant service, fantastic food and drink, can't recommend highly enough. If I go to Rome again I will defiantly be coming back"
Positive,1,"Try the truffle menu with wine pairingsTruly an experience to enjoy.  Right up there with the best restaurants in the world with one complaint.  The desserts were not up the the level of the rest of the meal at all.  However, don't let that put you off.  The rest of the meal was so outstanding that I could not mark them down for being disappointed in the dessert course. Go, enjoy and hope they improve dessert.  We come here every time we are in Rome."
Positive,1,Our favoriteOur second dinner in 4 years at Ad Hoc was simply fantastic. The service is top notch and the sommelier very knowledgeable and helpful. The food and the wine were the best we have had in Italy so far. We will return next time in Rome.
Positive,1,"Amazing ""white truffle menu""We had an amazing ""white truffle menu""!
With very tasting wines for each course.
The service was very good."
Positive,1,"Great food, fantastic wineThis was an absolutely lovely place. The waiters were fantastic and knowledgeable, the food was great, and the wine absolutely amazing. Really cozy place."
Positive,1,"Excellent restaurant - must visit in RomeAn excellent restaurant with very tasty food.
If you love truffles this is the place for you.
The service was very good, the waitress answered all our questions regarding the dishes.
We even got a wine to taste and a little present when we finished our great dinner (a small bottle of olive oil).
Recommended restaurant in Rome."
Positive,1,"Amazing ExperienceFrom the service to the setting to the food, the experience was truly amazing. 
The little touches for a birthday in our party was the cherry on the cake. 
Would recommend anyone visiting Rome to check this place out, especially if they are a fan of truffles!
We will definitely be returning when we visit Rome again."
Positive,1,"Cosy atmosphere and great foodWe visited Ad Hoc in July and had their tasting menu and wine. The restaurant has a cosy warm feel and the staff are very knowledgeable and welcoming. Every wonderful course we had was accompanied by delicious wine, so I can only thank the Ad Hoc team for a great dining experience."
Positive,1,"What a special mealAte here for our wedding anniversary.  Had the truffle taster menu.  The food and the service was outstanding.  The staff are extremely hard working and everyone seems to help out so we didn’t have the same waitress the whole night but they were all equally pleasant and professional. 

The food was divine however even with such small tasters you start to feel quite full by the time the desserts arrive and it’s a really interesting way to try new things and enjoy different Italian wines.  Including a small appetiser there are 6 lovely courses to get through.  Bread served on the side is also varied and tasty but it can fill you up.

This is not somewhere you would eat regularly but it is wonderful for a special occasion."
Positive,1,"FantasticWent here for our anniversary dinner. The restaurant is well known for its tasting menus and its truffle flavoured dishes. The service was good and the food and wine, paired through the tasting menu, excellent. Expensive, but this is fine dining and well worth it."
Positive,1,Excellent ExperienceI’ve read the negative reviews and our experience could not have been more pleasant. Albeit the tasting menu takes approximately 1-1.5 hours but that is part of the experience. The food and wine pairing were amazing and surprisingly we both left feeling more than satisfied in terms of the amount of food we ate. We found the staff to be pleasant and attentive and they provided numerous “free” treats and a small bottle of truffle oil when we left. Definitely worth the time and money.
Positive,1,"FantasticWe visited Ad Hoc for a 50th Birthday celebration, the food and service were brilliant, staff very warm friendly and helpful, very memorable evening"
Positive,1,An ExperienceThis place is very good service and food. Absolutely one of my best experiences with truffle. I had a delicious time. Thank you so much for treating us so well. The food was fantastic. I had the truffle experience.
Positive,1,"Amazing Resturant!Right from the moment we entered, we were greeted by the kind and proffessional hostess, who showed us into a very classy and cosy dining room, where we were immediatly offered a welcome drink.
We both had the Roman Tasting Menu, and were blown away by how much taste they managed to incorporate into the relatively simple dishes! Not to mention all the extra little treats we were offered by the kitchen free of charge!
The only problem that I could possibly point out, is our shock, when we finished our dessert, full and quite content, and were presented with yet another plate of small treats!

If you are ever in Rome, you should definetly vist Ad Hoc for a food experience that will stay with you!"
Positive,1,"Fabulous EveningFrom the moment we arrived we were looked after by all the staff.  We had  one of the tasting menus with wine flight and both the food and wines were fantastic.  Nothing was too much trouble and when my partner asked for a small ""top up"" he was brought another big glass. The atmosphere in the restaurant was lovely and we were given a gift at the en dof the evening - a little bottle of olive oil!  I cannot  recommend this restaurant highly enough!!!"
Positive,1,"AmazingI can honestly say we had the best food you can ever have in Rome. My husband and I had dinner there and it was a night to remember. The food was amazing great wine and delicious sweets . Definitely a big big thank you for Paula who was more than professional in knowing the food and wine menu , her recommendations were excellent and she is a very pleasant lady .

If in Rome again we will make sure to go back again ."
Positive,1,Amazing Restaurant in RomeI wish I could give this restaurant 10 stars! Food was delicious and service was amazing. My husband and I ordered the tasting menu with wine pairing and we absolutely loved the experience. We highly recommend this restaurant.
Positive,1,"A great experienceMy husband & I found this restaurant amongst nearest restaurant suggested by trip advisor. At first we weren’t impressed as people were not that nice but everything got better in time. The food was just amazing, they are truly good at truffles. I had carbonara pasta which was great. They also speak very good english."
Positive,1,"Amazing RestaurantWe celebrated our anniversary at Ad Hoc - the food, ambience and service were terrific.  This is our favorite restaurant in Rome.  If you travel to Rome, do yourself a favor and book a table.  Absolutely memorable."
Positive,1,"Decent foodThe food was above average, but the service is just okay. Ambience is casual and just okay too. Overall, it was a good experience.."
Positive,1,"Best restaurant we have ever been toWe celebrated here my birthday, everything was perfect -  the food, service and the atmosphere. Highly recommended!"
Positive,1,"Perfect evening at Ad HocAd hoc was everything we hoped for. Delicious food, friendly and unintrusive service, charming décor. Carbonara and truffle dishes particularly excellent. Would recommend it to everyone and can't wait to come back one year."
Positive,1,"Amazing RestuarantWe tried to get into this restaurant which was fully booked. Tried for a second night and was able to get a 9:30 PM Reservation.  To summarize, this place is amazing.  I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and am spoiled by the fine cuisine of my city. First of all the ambience and service were amazing.  The food is cooked to perfection and presented very nicely.  The staff fare very service oriented and provide a genuinely friendly service.  To top it off, the prices are about half of what I would have paid in the Bay area. If you are in Rome, you can't miss this place."
Positive,1,"Just WOW!I booked this restaurant as a surprise for my partners 60th Birthday and it certainly didn't disappoint.
I was very impressed that we didn't need to have the same taster menu - so many restaurants insist that you do.
However we both chose the 'land' menu. From start to finish the waitresses were so efficient and knowledgeable, clearly explaining each dish and  paired wine. There were also lovely extras thrown in too, such as a glass of fizz on arrival, an extra chef's special starter, homemade sweets after your dessert and a complimentary bottle of their own olive oil to take home. We also received a 10% discount for booking online. I would definitely visit here again on my next visit to Rome."
Positive,1,"Roman hospitality at its best.Lovely staff make for a most enjoyable foodie experience;helpful and knowledgeable. Food good, not outstanding but well presented. Taster menu not UK style, but different dishes simultaneously on a plate with different sections. Works ok but not the luxury pace of taster menus I am familiar with. 
Excellent wine selection."
Positive,1,"Last Night in RomeWonderful service,  fabulous food and lovely setting.   My husband said that the lasagna was unbelievably delicious. Highly recommend!"
Positive,1,"Ad HocThis is a little gem for foodies.
Lovely setting with welcoming staff. We were given complimentary fizz on arrival and we opted for the al a carte rather than the tasting menu. Food delicious with good quality wine at reasonable prices.
We loved it here and will be returning."
Positive,1,"Lovely dinner wonderful atmosphere!We had a wonderful dinner. They gave us a delicious sparkling wine at the start, a complimentary taste from the chef and a lovely selection of sweets at the end. The service and staff were so nice and helpful. Paula and Doriana were a delight. Recommend highly. Nice ambience and good location! Then they gave us a little bottle of olive oil as a parting gift. So lovely!  We will return!"
Positive,1,"Beautiful food, excellent service and all for a great priceWe decided to treat ourselves to a nice meal in Rome as we were celebrating a birthday and so we chose Ad Hoc based on the reviews. 

This truly has to be one of the best meals we have ever had. On sitting down at your table you are provided with a free glass of sparkling wine and a complementary starter. Can’t fault a start like that. Next, all the dishes we ordered were fantastic. I ordered the pasta with octopus followed by the sea bass and both were delicious and the portions bigger than expected. The pasta was the best we had in Italy so I def recommend you give that a go. 

The service was incredible throughout but at no point rushed. The waitresses were lovely and very attentive (but not too much like in some restaurants). We even got a free dessert thrown in which was amazing. 

All in, eur 120 for a bottle of wine, two Pasta dishes and two mains inc service (plus all the freebies). Brilliant price for a wonderful experience."
Positive,1,"Excellent eveningI went here with my family after reading reviews online,  and it did not disappoint! Amazing interesting italian food, atmosphere and service. Would 100% recommend to anyone staying in Rome!"
Positive,1,ExcellentFood was absolutely excellent and staff friendly attentive and 11/10. Thoroughly enjoyable evening and highly recommend.
Positive,1,Excellent ExperienceWhat a lovely anniversary dinner at Ad Hoc. Delicious tasting menus were full of surprises and the service was very friendly.
Positive,1,"Italian graciousnessIn May a group of us traveled to Italy for a wonderful vacation.  One evening, while in Rome, we were thrilled to eat at Ad Hoc.  What a wonderful restaurant.  I should say here that I am gluten intolerant.  But, no worries here.  The staff went out of their way to make sure my dishes were perfect.  We were a large group of 9 and we were treated with the same care as a table of 2.  One of our group even entertained some of the staff with napkin folds and some magic tricks.  The wine list was extensive and we had the perfect guidance leading us to choose the perfect wines for our evening.  When we returned home the owner even sent us copies of some of his favorite recipes.  The experience was like dining at your very favorite restaurant in your very favorite city but this time in Rome.  Thank you so much."
Positive,1,"Special mealEvery course of our meal was excellent.  Complimentary sparkling wine to start, the roulade in phyllo dough with prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella, delightful array of various breads, the vermicelli with bacon and truffles, beef cheeks, a lamb special, and the Tuscany beef fillet with truffles and a wonderful wine selection. We were content with our meals and passed on dessert however the restaurant treated us to an array of very satisfying and delicious sweets and a bottle of their olive oil to take home.  This was a special meal to remember.  Highly recommend this place."
Positive,1,Wonderful Mea!Lovely hidden gem in the heart of Rome. They have 4 tasting menus (with one that specializes in truffles). All come with an optional wine tasting. Food was delicious and service was attentive. Highlight of the meal was a carbonara 3 ways. Would highly recommend - and make sure you get the tasting menu!
Positive,1,"A hidden gemWe booked here based purely on the 5 star reviews and their very tempting website... unbelievable experience, very friendly and helpful staff, food was top notch with an amazing red to match along with a beautiful parting gift, our best meal in Rome by far, highly recommend"
Positive,1,"Great restaurant!Excellent food, staff and atmosphere!!! They took a while with the food but we were compensate with an amazing dessert! We will come back for sure!"
Positive,1,"Hidden GemWe went to this restaurant after recommendation from our hotel, wonderful, friendly welcome into a cosy restaurant. So many wines displayed on wall. Staff couldn’t do enough for you. Lots of little extras, food was good but if I return to Rome and go there again wouldn’t have tasting menu as far too much food. Really good value for money and worth a visit but need to book."
Positive,1,"Perfect nightIve been to this restaurant 6 years apart and what i can say is both times were a lovely experience great staff great service and great food,best carbonara i have ever tasted with some stunning truffles.
We were given a very nice private table and the waitress were so attentive to everything.

Well done! Would visit over and over again !"
Positive,1,"Beautiful restaurantThe food is good , the atmosphere is great , service the best = perfect dinner

Most impressive, it made me keep thinking about this restaurant although after 2 months.

Good work ,  keep it up"
Positive,1,"FABULOUSEverything all the five star reviews promised. Great space, fabulous attentive knowledgeable staff, well paced service, interesting menu and superb cooking. And at 250 euro for four, a good portion of which was for wine, we think good value. Happily adding this to our personal list of top global restaurants."
Positive,1,"Wonderful MealWe ate here in late June while visiting Rome. Reservation for 4 at 20:00. Everything was wonderful - absolutely wonderful. The staff was beyond accommodating and made us feel as though we were the only ones in the restaurant. We all ordered the tasting menu (no pressure at all from the staff) - 3 with wine, 1 without. We were able to make substitutions between the tasting menus to satisfy our cuisine preferences. Portions were very fair - both food and wine. No skimping. Wine was well paired (and generously poured) and the food was simply delicious.  Can’t wait to go back!"
Positive,1,"Excellent atmosphere and food!We are a family of foodies and this night we where celebrating the birthdays of our daughters. We decided to go to this well received restaurant. The service was warm and personal and they spent time to assist and discuss different wine pairings throughout the evening. Great! The choice of wines are very good and the walls are being used as wine storage. 
The aim of the restaurant was be perceived as a high end traditional Italian restaurant in a fine dining wrapping (complementary  dishes, service, attention to all details). They succeeded very well being developing a warm, personal atmosphere with fantastic dishes. The pasta was in our opinion the best we have had at a restaurant in our lives! If they want to be more fine dining there are details to be refined (smaller portions, more structured service and attention to details. ) Don't interpret me wrong. The place is fantastic and the service and atmosphere is what we want in Italy. The wines tasted was a Nebbiolo from Valtellina and a great Etna Rosso!. Well matched to the dishes.
Small notes to be refined- Given the quality of the wines they need to be chilled before served. Now they were served in the same temperature (approx 25 degrees). A few minutes in a wine cooler (also for the reds) are recommended.

Can highly recommend Ad Hoc"
Positive,1,"Best Restaurant for romantic dinnerAd Hoc was excellent in terms of atmosphere, food, and service. Been there for dinner with wife and from the beginning, we felt really good and relaxed. The restaurant decor is really nice (bottle of wines on the shelfs and walls) and makes feel comfy and give you that feeling that you're in a nice restaurant   Staff was very helpful and informative, explain the menu in details and also they knew their food and wine. Food is really good but for my taste, the truffle dishes are a bit overpowered by truffle which is very fresh and intensive but that's only our opinion. Food presentation was really good, well-executed and really tasty. In the end, we pay 180 euros which I believe it was a fair price for the whole experience we also get two boxes of sweets and complementary Ad Hoc olive oil. That was a nice touch for our dinner. Generally well worth it to go why you in Rome especially for romantic dinner."
Positive,1,"Superb restaurant.Good food. They have a lot of truffle dishes. Very good selection of wines. Friendly staff. The waitress Stella, who attended us was amazing. Got a 10% discount by booking a table on their website. Not to be missed when in Rome."
Positive,1,"Romantic dinnerHad a simply lovely evening here.  Wine list is like a text book!  The cubes carbonara three ways was unbelievably delicious.  They gave us complimentary sparkling wine on arrival, a delightful amuse bouche and a darling little bottle of olive oil at the end of our evening.  The entire evening was near perfection!"
Positive,1,"The Best RestaurantI took my wife, niece & mother-in-law on a road trip from Rome to Florence and then to Venice.  I picked out the best restaurants that I could find in each city, and booked them all in advance.  We all agreed that Ad Hoc was the best restaurant of the trip.  The staff were all very friendly from when we walked into the restaurant to when we said goodbye.  They made us feel welcome, and were happy to answer all of our questions.  The food was fabulous, from the appetizers to the dessert.  I had the sea bass which was exquisite, and the pasta was fresh, homemade and delicious.  They had an excellent variety of Italian wines at reasonable prices.  One of my colleagues is going to Rome in August, and Ad Hoc is the only restaurant that I recommended to her.  It's a must for any trip to Rome."
Positive,1,They made dining a personal experienceAd Hoc was fantastic in terms of food quality as well as experience. They were very friendly and explained their menu is detail. We loved sitting by all the wine bottles.
Positive,1,great restaurant with excellent foodReally enjoyed the tasting menu at the restaurant.  Also the service was superb.  Advised to book early as we had to call three times to check cancellation.  It was well worth it.
Positive,1,"Sooo Good!!  The food kept coming!We're from the States. Bumped into a couple from SF and they told us about this restaurant. So glad they did.  Took a taxi to the spot.  They started us off with complimentary wine, bread, olive oil, balsamic. I think we ate 4 or 5 courses of food.  We had more wine and complimentary dessert as well.  They gave us a small bottle of their olive oil. Each course was delicious.  What's even better... It was only $40 US!  I would go here again and again.  Sooo good.  You will not leave hungry!"
Positive,1,"Great food and excellent selection of winesThe warm and welcoming vibe hooks you up from the moment you sit at the table. Staff is very friendly and tries to keep your happy all the time, although sometimes the service is a bit slow (it didn't ruin our experience at all - just be aware). The food is great. We were lucky to visit the place during annual truffles festival, so all dishes had an option to be lifted up with few slices of black truffle (yummy!!!). The basket with flavored breads selection was a nice touch. And the wine list (more like an endless scroll) served its purpose well. From the food I would recommend Carbonara al cubo and Guancia  Manzo Tartufo."
Positive,1,Superb EveningWe went to this lovely restaurant as part of a weekend away for my fiance's birthday. The food and service were excellent with an amazing wine choice. I would strongly recommend going but make sure you book in advance.
Positive,1,"Fantastic restaurantWent there for my wife’s birthday and enjoyed their tasting menu. The food was lovely, the wine was great and the restaurant itself was perfect.

It is not cheap but the quality was worth paying for, I would definitely return."
Positive,1,"WowowowWent to Ad Hoc last Thursday to celebrate my boyfriends 30th birthday. Food was amazing and the wine too, staff were great, place looks fantastic! 
Thank you so much"
Positive,1,"Ad hoc rocksWe had a wonderful meal at Ad Hoc on our last night in Rome.  We had been in Italy for over two weeks and ate at two Michelin one star restaurants prior - the food at Ad Hoc was as good or better - incredible service, sommelier was terrific and matched great wines - we will be back"
Positive,1,"Wonderful cuisine, lovely service, and unbelievable wine selection!Let's just put it this way - the combination of delicious cuisine, great ambiance, warm and welcoming staff, and superior selection of wine ensures that we will definitely return on our next trip to Rome. Besides, I need to sample that lovely Sassicaia that was furtively beckoning me throughout our meal!"
Positive,1,"Very Special Find!This dinner exceeded my expectations! I don't want to spoil too much for you in case you go, but their attention to detail, and the little extra touches, really make this dining experience something worth enjoying while in Rome. They also have an entire truffle menu! You definitely need reservations, so make those ahead of time."
Positive,1,"Amazing FindAs soon as we walked in we knew we were in for a treat!  It is very cozy inside, away from the hustle and bustle of Rome.  The wine menu was great and the wine knowledge was very impressive.
We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The service was great. An extra touch was a small bottle of olive oil that was given to us as a favor. 
Would definitely recommend and next time we are in Rome we will dine there!"
Positive,1,"Still amazing! 😍My 5th visit in 5 years! How could we possibly visit this magical City without going to Ad Hoc for a fabulous, indulgent dinner? One of the best restaurants I’ve EVER been to!!! Got a fabulous sparkling welcome back from the lovely team and enjoyed an amazing truffle based feast and fabulous wine. We will be back again for sure! Please open in London! It would be amazing too 😍😍😍
Thank you again for yet another wonderful evening!!! 😘😘😘"
Positive,1,"Perfect meal - Everything absolutely fantasticFrom start to finish the food was incredible. 
Service fantastic especially for Rome! 
Their selection of wines must be one of the best in the city. 
Definitely recommend Ad-Hoc for an amazing culinary experience.

See you next time we are in Rome!

Arrivederci"
Positive,1,"OUTSTANDING EXPERIENCE - The best we've ever had!Our family of 7 had dinner at Ad Hoc in June, 2019.  The experience was likely the best we've ever had.  From the second we walked in until the second we walked out, we were treated like royalty and family.  Every detail was attended to, we had our own space in the back of the restaurant, and our server felt like she'd known us for years.  She continued to bring us unexpected treats from the chef throughout the night and gave us each a small bottle of olive oil as a favor.  The food as well was outstanding.  We couldn't have asked for anything more."
Positive,1,"Seriously good restaurantOur highest recommendation to the team behind and at Ad Hoc. Perfect atmosphere, high quality staff and excellent food,. We had the truffle menu with following wine and it was very balanced and excellent set together. Definitely a visit worth and we will come back next time visiting Rome.

Positive,1,"Anniversary CelebrationI took my wife to this restaurant while visiting Rome in early June.
It is a very busy restaurant but they were able to fit us in for a 9 30pm sitting. We opted for the taster menu with wine selection to accompany the food. Well the food was absolutely amazing! I lost count of the amount of food brought to our table over 5 or 6 courses. We thought the wine might be small but we were wrong. The wines brougt to us were in quite sizable glasses so a very good quantity was served. And each piece of food or wine brought to us was described in terms of where it came from by the knowledgeable and enthusiastic staff. If you like good quality food at a reasonable price I would strongly recommend this restaurant as one to put on your visit list."
Positive,1,"excellent dinner at reasonable pricesWe were in Rome for just two nights and had dinner with friends on the last night at this lovely small restaurant on via Ripetta. The restaurant is small and cozy, quite close to Piazza del Popolo. Service and recommendations were excellent. The ladies received a small bottle of their delicious olive oil as a gift. Most dishes include truffles and all were delicious. Prices are quite reasonable also. Highly recommended."
Positive,1,"Best Restaurant in Rome!Cannot say enough good things about this restaurant and you need to eat here when you're in Rome no matter what!  The staff was so charming (and funny) and welcoming and the wine staff is some of the best.  My fiancé and I are still dreaming of the truffle carboneras we had.  Every wall and space of the entire restaurant is covered floor to ceiling in wine bottles and it provided a truly unique and special atmosphere.  My fiancé is a big ""foody"" and this was her favorite meal in Italy.  Highly recommend!!"
Positive,1,"This. Was. Awesome!!!To start, the cozy space with mostly wine bottles on the walls is lovely. The very friendly and helpful staff and knowledgeable sommelier were excellent. The truffle tasting menu absolutely blew us away, especially with the wine pairings. I will come back here every time I come to Rome!"
Positive,1,You must eat here!!!Went here for my birthday dinner while in Rome a few days ago. Service and food was excellent! I will definitely return. I highly recommend it!
Positive,1,My very first dinner in Italy - Ad HocI just want to let everyone know that Ad Hoc is the very first restaurant we dine in Roma Italy. We loved everything we experienced; from the food to service and ambiance. All the dishes we ordered were very delicious. Italian knows how to cook! It specializes in truffle. We searched online before we came and we were so happy that we made the right choice. Dining at Ad Hoc was a great pleasure and memorable. We would definitely recommend it to all of our friends who will go to Italy in the future.
Positive,1,"Very good Tasting MenuWe choose Tasting Roman. All very good - but none that I will give top score and none really disappointing. . 

The kitchen must be careful so there are no unwanted things in the dishes."
Positive,1,"Very good in all waysVery nice atmosphere, good service, good food. Overall all a very satisfactory experience. The entire group of 8 loved dining there."
Positive,1,"Great overall dining experienceAd Hoc was recommended by our concierge and it did not disappoint! The atmosphere was classy and romantic and we loved being surrounded by beautiful wine bottles.  

The menu was offered the perfect amount of choices and both our entrees were excellent.  On top of the great food, the service staff was professional and kind. 

It was our favorite restaurant in Rome!"
Positive,1,"First Class set menu and wine pairingsIntimate restaurant, excellent food and wine- as good as many M'lin* set menus for a vert reasonable price. Wine pairings great.

If you miss this place, you are missing out-highly recommended."
Positive,1,"Great food, Friendly service, Fair pricesI visited the resturant with my wife for dinner. We are both vegeterian and found special and vaery tasty dishes, which were served by a friendly staff.
It was a unique dinner and I can defeneitly recommend it when visitng Rome."
Positive,1,"Our favourite meal in RomeWe had a perfect dinner at Ad Hoc from start to finish. We were sat at a nice table near the windows and surrounded by bottles of wine. The wine list is very impressive and interesting, and the dishes we had were all fantastic, especially the beef tartare with truffles. The lady who served us (who we think is the manager) was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about wine, and recommended a very nice local red to go with our meal. In the end we even received olive oil gift from the restaurant!"
Positive,1,"Superb dinnerThe place is very cosy and confortable;we had a nice private room for the 8 of us.
Food and coocking are excellent; truffle of course, but other dishes also. The choice of wines is huge, including magnums.
Service is very attentive with a delicate surprise for my wife's birthday."
Positive,1,Excellent4 of us ate here on Saturday night. Excellent food and service throughout. Thoroughly enjoyed it all. Nice slow service which made a change from other restaurants. Would definitely recommend.
Positive,1,Great food and wine!Amazing food and atmosphere. We did the Roman style cuisine testing menu + the wine pairing and it did not disappoint. Great option if you can't make up your mind and want to try a lot of different things. The pasta with truffles was our favorite. And they even gave us a small bottle of olive oil to take home!
Positive,1,"Truffle Madness!SO overdue for this review, I and my husband went last year for our honeymoon vacation in Italy. My esthetician suggested Ad Hoc and I'm super glad we went because they have a separate menu just of truffles! Book in advance online, it was very easy to do so. And upon arrival our waitress greeted us with some prosecco, super nice of her to do so. We tried the prix fix menu, of course  from the truffle menu. Everything was delicious and we were open to try everything. Each dish came with wine pairing, and portions were good. The staff is very sweet and talked about every dish we received. At the end of our meal the waitress gifted me their olive oil, and I have to say we left full and extremely happy. I would definitely go back when in Rome. :) The experience was memorable."
Positive,1,"FantasticFrom start to finish this was one of my best experiences ever in Italy. The staff were so welcoming and friendly and answered every question we had also they helped us to combine our degustation menu with two bottles of wine . The food was incredible, we’ve had an amazing dinner.."
Positive,1,"Excellent food, service and ambianceWe had the degustation menu combined with the wines and it was divine. Be aware that they serve a lot of food and wine! You will be full and satisfied. The wine selection was particularly amazing. The service is also outstanding! I would go again next time I am in Rome :)"
Positive,1,"Great dinnerExcellent food, excellent service !!!
We celebrated birthday and the chef and hosts were contributing to get a fantastic dinner"
Positive,1,Fantastico!It begins with world class ambience in a beautifully decorated dining area surrounded by hundreds of bottles of wine! Then world class service  from a charming waitress who provided us a complimentary glass of prosseco and explained the menu for the evening. Finally the food was well prepared and excellently presented. All in all a must restaurant if you are ever in Rome!
Positive,1,Fantastic dinnerWe had best time enjoying dinner at Ad Hoc. Food and wine was amazing - best we had in Rome during our trip. Waitresses provided top service - very friendly - we highly recommend this place if you visting Rome.
Positive,1,"You won’t find finer dining in Rome!Dear Massimiliano, 

Firstly I would like to thank you, and your staff for an excellent night at your restaurant. As you know it was for my 50th birthday, and so it was a very special evening. From the moment we walked in “Roma” greeted us with smiles and showed us to our table. 

Nothing was too much trouble, and Roma explained how the menu worked, and if we wanted, we could change 1 or 2 of the dishes. The food was excellent, and everyone in our group said it was the best dining experience they had ever had! The wines were excellent too, and again, we could change them if needed. “Roma” explained in great detail about every food dish and the accompanying wine served with them. Which vineyard they came from and the grape used. 

We were initially going to go to Harry’s Bar, as I have visited there many times before when in Rome. May I say your food, wine and service exceeded any of these visits, and when we return to Rome, we will definitely be booking with you. 

Thank you so much, and please thank “Roma” and the chef for making a special evening, unforgettable."
Positive,1,"Outstanding Dining ExperienceOur evening at Ad Hoc proved to be fantastic in every way.  We had made reservations well in advance (a must) and we were seated in a beautiful dining room surrounded with shelves of wine bottles, beautifully lit.  We were immediately treated to complimentary glasses of prosecco while we viewed the menu.  I had the truffle tasting menu with wine pairings, and I highly recommend it.  It started with pumpkin blossoms with ricotta and truffles.  For primo, tonnarelli pasta with butter, parmesan and truffles.  For the main course I chose the braised beef cheeks with truffles.  This was followed by a selection of desserts.  The wine pairings were just right, and I was particularly pleased with the Amarone served with the beef.  Throughout, the service was attentive and cordial.  As a parting gift, we received a bottle of their own branded olive oil- an excellent reminder of a dining experience in Rome to be remembered."
Positive,1,"Returned and not disappointedIf you like food then this is simply a must visit. The whole dining experience is amazing. Our second visit and we were prepared to eat well. I chose the tasting menu [land] with wine pairing and it was excellent. My wife had learnt from her previous experience and opted for something less substantial. 
Highlights in a meal of high quality were my wife's pasta/ragout with truffles and pretty much all of my selection. The wines matched beautifully and the waitresses were so knowledgeable and articulate. 

Truly amazing. Number 1 on my list of things to do should we visit Rome for a third time."
Positive,1,"Fantastic choice for a special eveningAfter checking other reviews, I have chosen this restaurant to propose to my girlfriend on a lovely February evening in Rome. And I have been very happy with my choice! Quality of the food and wines is excellent, service is very friendly and they have gone over the limit to help me in order to make this special evening memorable. Highly recommended to anyone visiting Rome!"
Positive,1,"GrahamWow. What a restaurant. What can I say. From start to finish this was one of my best  dining experiences ever. The staff were so welcoming, very friendly and knew their food and wine (which is very important in Italy). The food was incredible and the montepuociano I had was one of the best Iv ever tasted. The little touch of a free gift of their own olive oil when we left just summed up the quality and detail of the place. Couldn’t recommend highly enough."
Positive,1,"Fabulous!Everything about Ad Hoc works. From the warm welcome to the lovely room which is decorated with a vast array of wine bottles. Service and quality always seem to be the key focus of the staff, we were seated and quickly given a complimentary and welcoming glass of prosecco while we made our choices from the menu. As with previous evenings we tried a variety of starters before moving onto the pasta/main courses. We also ordered some white wine by the glass and an excellent value Cabernet Sauvignon from the Hofstatter estate in the Alto Aldige.

The food was excellent, great flavor and top-quality ingredients. The Tonnarelli with butter, parmesan and truffle was especially memorable."
Positive,1,Absolutely incredible meal!This was our favourite meal of Rome. Between me and my boyfriend we shared the land tasting menu and the sea tasting menu with the wine pairings and it was absolutely delicious. The staff were very friendly and even gave us a bottle of olive oil to take away. 10/10 would recommend
Positive,1,"Excellent dinner in a romantic settingI did one of the tasting menus and loved everything on it. Pumpkin flowers, tartar, and my personal favorite was the carbonara three ways. Only downside is that by the time I got to the main course I was so full that I couldn't fully enjoy it - so come hungry! Service was great, they were very attentive and nice."
Positive,1,"DinnerExcelent quality, service, wines, place. Perhaps a little slow but they served us ""without reservation""."
Positive,1,"Glad we bookedI had read on Trip Advisor about this restaurant and booked before we flew to Rome.  The only reservation I could get was at 9.30 on our last evening and I am so glad that we decided to go for it.  It is in a quiet (at night) side street between the Via del Corso and the river and the first thing we noticed on entering was the delicious smell of truffle.  It took us a very long time to choose what to eat as there was such a choice but in the end we went for one of the tasting menus with matching wines and every single bit of food on our plates was delicious, especially the truffled pasta.  The recommended wines were all red but they changed these to rose/white to suit our taste and were wonderful. All the waiting staff were female and were first rate.  I can't recommend this restaurant highly enough."
Positive,1,"Great food, wonderful serviceThe service at Ad Hoc is wonderful, the wine list is the most impressive I have ever seen in my life. We had the roman and land tasting menu's - most of the food was wonderful, there were a few things that were just okay for me. Come very hungry because there is A LOT of food, and the portions are large. All in all, it's worth a trip - I can highly recommend the carbonara three ways, the suckling pig, the beef pasta/pea&asparagus ravioli course and the dessert."
Positive,1,"Wonderful Dinner at Ad Hoc ..We visited Ad Hoc whilst on a long weekend to Rome, we had booked before leaving London. Reservations in advance are a must. We arrived a little early, were given a warm welcome, told our table would be ready soon. Whilst we waited we savoured the warmth of the restaurant, the aroma of truffles & listened to the happy buzz of of diners having a great time. We were shown to our table after a few mins & served a complimentary glass of Italian Sparkling Wine to drink whilst we looked at the menus.  Everything on the menu sounded  absolutely delicious, we could have ordered everything! In the end of long deliberations we both decided on a taster menu, there was a choice of 4, so we could sample a little of many dishes! We made an excellent choice, everything we tasted we loved & the dishes were presented beautifully.  Truffle Pasta 10/10! Suckling Pork 10/10 Dessert of Italian Vanilla Creme & sponge 10/10 scrummy! You can also have wine to accompany each course of the taster menus, we chose white wine & were served a selection of excellent Italian wines & dessert wine.  The food & wine were all 10/10, but very best of all about Ad Hoc are the staff. They create a calm, happy, friendly, relaxed & attentive atmosphere. They were also very  knowledgeable about their menu & extensive Italian wine selection. It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Nothing was too much of an effort for them, it felt like dining with great friends. I hope I get to return again one day. Book Ad Hoc, you won’t regret it."
Positive,1,"Wonderful DinnerI chose Ad Hoc for our final dinner in Italy after three weeks traveling around the country with two other couples, Ad Hoc provided a wonderful finally to our trip. The food, service and atmosphere was impeccable. The sommelier Edna did a great job finding great wines from their extensive wine list. 
The decor of the remodeled restaurant provides an intimate dining experience. The food, all with black truffles was worth the price.

I would recommend Ad Hoc to anyone who wants a intimate wonderful dining experience in Rome."
Positive,1,Perfect venue for our 10th anniversaryThis restaurant excels in every respect. The staff were friendly but professional and helpful when it came to assisting with the menu. The wine list is huge but many wines are served by the glass. The real diamond here is the food which was exceptional. I had mentioned when booking that we were celebrating our anniversary and when we came to leave we were given a bottle of fizz which was a lovely touch. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. I will be going again next time I'm in Rome for sure. 10/10 all day long 👍
Positive,1,"Incredible dinner and locationGreat dinner! Amazing high quality food, appetizer and pre pudding offered by them despite a la carte menù. Mix of traditional Roman dishes and high end cousine. Very nice ambiance, tables surrounded by the broad and varied collection of wine that As Hoc cantine offers (the wine list is 200 pages!).
Relaxed but not too slow pace. Reasonably priced high quality food.
Amazing dinner experience!"
Positive,1,"Insane birthday dinner with course after course of great food and wineMy boyfriend booked this as a surprise for my birthday and it did not disappoint. We had the truffle dining experience which involved several courses surrounding featuring truffles. By the end we had 12 courses as the added extras just kept coming. The food was delicious and definitely meant we tried stuff we wouldn’t normally have, although by the end it’s safe to say I couldn’t eat it all. We had the added wine tasting experience which included good quality wines from local regions at a very reasonable price so would highly recommend adding this. 

The restaurant service was great. The staff were attentive and very welcoming and even brought my dessert out with a candle in and sang to me happy birthday in Italian. They after gave me a little bottle of olive oil to take home from their local production site. It was a lovely touch!"
Positive,1,Excellent Italian Cuisine - Wonderful Atmosphere - Friendly ServiceVery nice restaurant - excellent Italian food as expected - friendly and courteous service. No complaint. Can be recommended 100%.
Positive,1,"Don’t eat for 24 hrs beforeWe booked in advance after reading the reviews and it did not disappoint! We were greeted with a free prosecco on arrival and chose the land tasting menu with drink pairing. We were given complimentary pre starter, pre dessert & post dessert as well as the 4 courses offered. It was so much food, we were totally stuffed. It was an amazing dining experience made better by the friendly staff for which nothing was too much trouble, even got a free bottle of olive oil to take home. If you’re in Rome looking for something a little special then this is your place.

Positive,1,"Nice spot near Piazza ColonnaVery good food, nice ambience. The service was a little abrupt, but other than that, it’s a great spot."
Positive,1,"Great food, wonderful wine and fun staff.Ad Hoc was recommended and booked for us by Anna at our favorite hotel The First Roma. Its a fantastic warm place with wine boxes lining the walls and candles on the tables.  It's in a fantastic part of town only a fifteen-minute walk from the Trevi Fountain. 
My fiancee is a huge foodie and we eat at some of the best restaurants in the world. The food at Ad Hoc is at a really affordable price point, and for the dining experience we had, we were surprised it didn't cost more. We had the tasting menu with matching wines and were blown away. 
We are back in Rome at the moment and couldn't get a table, and we understand why. 
It's wonderful. ...go!  

Adam"
Positive,1,Highly Recommend!We ate supper at Ad Hoc and we were a bit worried about how expensive it would be but the prices were reasonable for the quality of the food.  We were greeted with sparkling wine in a warm and inviting wine library.  The tasting menu with wine pairings was excellent and the service outstanding.  They even gifted our wives a small bottle of their house olive oil...nice touch.  Would go back there in a heartbeat!
Positive,1,"Brilliant meal, lovely settingBooked a meal here for me and my boyfriend whilst visiting Rome for his birthday and they did not disappoint! Booked this purely on all the great reviews. 
I had let the restaurant know prior that we were visiting for a birthday and they had kindly brought out a dessert singing happy birthday (to my boyfriend embarrassment) 
Everything from the glass of Prosecco to start, enters, starters, mains and desserts was excellent.
Would highly recommend a visit when in Rome. 
I had cod starter, my boyfriend had the meat platter I think?
I had octopus spaghetti and he had salmon ravioli 
Everything was beautiful."
Positive,1,"Wine wine wine!  And suckling pig!The ambience is wonderful. The staff is outstanding. Paula listened to our wine preferences and then selected 4 bottles to choose from, giving great information on them and detail about why we might like each. The suckling pig is to die for."
Positive,1,Return visit as impressive as the firstOur first visit to this restaurant was in 2012.  My wife and I were so impressed with the dining experience that we booked a table for us and 6 of our friends as soon as we knew we would be returning to Rome in April 2019.  All 8 of us agreed that this what the best meal we had during our time in Rome and have been talking about the experience ever since. This is the type of restaurant where you let the waiter or waitress tell you what to order and sit back and enjoy the experience.  I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant to anybody visiting Rome and we will certainly be back again on our next trip to Italy.
Positive,1,"Romantic restaurant with fab food!One word sums up this restaurant, wow! Me and my boyfriend wanted a fancy meal for our last night in Rome and this place was the perfect choice. From our arrival we were looked after, the staff were attentive and knowledgable from the wine to the food. Speaking of the wine, the wine list is huge and gives you a break down by region. Then the food! It was amazing. I had the cod to start and it was one of the best things I had all trip. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone. It is pricy but so worth it."
Positive,1,"We enjoyed every moment....It was my wife's birthday and our first visit to Rome. Ad Hoc looked the perfect place for a celebration meal and we weren't disappointed. The ambiance is perfect, the staff attentive and knowledgeable without being overbearing, the wine excellent and the food marvellous. We had the Roman and The Sea tasting menus and every last mouthful was beautifully served and tasted delicious. I particularly enjoyed the Black Truffle Carbonara and my wife loved the Octopus. The wines were perfectly matched to each course. I would return without hesitation."
Positive,1,"Lovely!I don't know how we managed to miss this on previous trips, but am thrilled we tried it on this trip.  A charming, welcoming dining room with a fabulous wine list.  Food was absolutely delicious, well prepared and beautifully presented.  A wonderful evening."
Positive,1,Good food but spendyOur visit to the Ad Hoc was very pleasant. We had a 5 course meal and everything tasted good. This was my wife’s favorite place because of the selection of wine. We left paying $150 for dinner and that was with the 10% discount we found for booking in advance.
Positive,1,Fabulous restaurantI took my 11 year old grandson here for the last night of our trip to Rome on Tuesday 9th April 2019. The ambience food and service was second to none. If ever in Rome again we would definitely return. It is worth saying that although 11 years old my grandson loves smart restaurants and fine dining so this was perfect for him.
Positive,1,"Excellent! Superb dinner experience.Celebrated our 26 year anniversary with a taste menu dinner with wine package - Food, wine, service and environment was superb
Thank you AdHoc :-)"
Positive,1,"Perfect dining experience at Ad Hoc Restaurant.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!My wife and I celebrated our 20 year Anniversary at Ad Hoc Restaurant on March 26.  We could not have chosen a better restaurant!  Our menu choice that evening was the 'Seafood Tasting' that included wine.

We arrived at 7:00pm and left at 11:30pm.  Yes, we were there 4 1/2 hours, and loved every minute of it!  From your gracious hostess the moment we walked in, perfect service, incredible courses, and perfectly matched wines, our dinner far exceeded our hopes and expectations.  We were offered a complimentary glass of Prosecco as we arrived, and even offered a very thoughtful 'thank you' gift for visiting as we departed.

20 years ago my wife and I honeymooned in France, France at a restaurant that FODOR's at the time rated the #1 restaurant in the world.  We spent 4 hours for dinner their that evening.  We rate our dinner experience at Ad Hoc Restaurant every bit as memorable and enjoyable as our dinner in France.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone visiting Rome to make sure that you dine at AD HOC Restaurant.  It is reasonably priced, food is over the top outstanding as well as the service."
Positive,1,"Excellent!!!!Great people , Great place ! really enjoyed my time in the restaurant + great great food!
Highly recommend this place for couples + buisness + family."
Positive,1,"Fantastic!We had an outstanding  meal here.  Upon being seated, the hostess brought us complimentary glasses of Prosecco, which was a very nice gesture.  My daughter and I shared the pumpkin blossoms, stuffed with ricotta cheese and asparagus.  Lightly battered and fried, they were delicious!  My husband had Vermicelli with octopus-
With garlic, oil, chilli pepper, cherry tomatoes and pecorino di fossa cheese, while my son-in law had the stuffed cannelloni.  For main courses, my daughter had the lamb special, my son-in-law had the Tuscany beef fillet erved with buttered spinach and roasted potatoes, and I had the vermicelli with octopus.  We were so stuffed, we did not order dessert, but we were brought a tower of Italian cookies, and other delights.  This meal was fabulous!  The owner brought the women a small bottle of virgin olive oil, and the men got the bill!!!!"
Positive,1,"Fantastic meal for a special occasionWe booked in advance for my birthday night in Rome. We chose the tasting menu, both had the land option and were not disappointed. The best food we ate in Rome. The wines with the courses were beautiful and the service was excellent. The staff were happy to explain everythung on the plates and the wines that accompanied them. I would recommend to anyone, slightly more expensive so maybe for a special occasion."
Positive,1,"Great great restaurant! Must visit when in RomeWe had a very nice evening in this restaurant. The food was very tastefull & the service was beyond great! Very kind staff that will help you & have very good knowledge of their products and wine. Also, it was my birthday and they suprised me with dessert! When in rome —> go to this restaurant!! We do recommend you to make a reservation!"

Positive,1,"Great placeOne of the best restaurants I have ever eaten in and I have eaten in many.
Great food and service.
I have recommended the restaurant to friends and will definitely return myself."
Positive,1,"Experience not to forgetContrary to many restaurant in this part of Rome, this is not a touristic place, but a nice, quiet dining experience. Excellent and very attended staff makes your dining experience unforgettable. We had menu, that was well balanced in quality and quantity, accompanied by carefully selected wines, it was also stress free to make a choice, as menu let us to try many different, and all excellent dishes. If next time in Rome, we will surely return. I hope the reader finds this review interesting and will book the table at Ad Hoc - its worth it..."
Positive,1,"Birthday partyIt was my daughter's 19th birthday and I recommended her to gather with her friends for dinner.
We chose Ad Hoc as fine dining restaurant with beautiful ambiance. 
What a wonderful place!
Food, staff, wines, tasting menus- ALL EXCELLENT. 
And special care for my big girl!
 😍🥰
Thank you All for making her evening so special! 
Grazie mille!"
Positive,1,"AnytimeNice, good, superb - that is the words. 
We would go there Anytime Again.
It is a “must do” on a bucket list for Rome"
Positive,1,"In expected surpriseWe were looking for a place for dinner one night in Rome and happened upon Ad Hoc. 
Very pleasant surprise. Food was outstanding, the wine selection was excellent, the truffles divine and the service was very friendly. 
We truly enjoyed our meal."
Positive,1,"Fabulous food, atmosphere and staffI made a reservation at Ad Hoc for our first evening in Rome, the food was excellent as was the service and atmosphere. We enjoyed it so much we made a reservation for our final night and again everything was excellent. On our first visit we chose from the a la carte menu for our second visit we chose the ‘Land’ tasting menu, both were delicious and would highly recommend Ad Hoc to anyone visiting Rome. 
Thank you for two fabulous evenings."
Positive,1,"A perfect eveningAfter doing a great deal of research before booking this restaurant I was delighted to find that it more than exceeded our expectations.
The warm welcome we received allowed us to relax from the moment we entered this beautiful restaurant. The ambiance enhances the experience with thoughtful lighting, enough table space and a little background music.
Further welcomed with glass of dry Prosecco we settled at our more than comfortable table.
My wife chose the Roman tasting menu whilst I selected the Land tasting menu both with wine pairings.
 At 85 euros each (10% discount if you book online) it proved to be great value for money.
Highlights from an extensive offerings were the ravioli filled with cheese with asparagus and cream.
Beef tartar, carbonara with truffle and the desert of soft Roman cake with cherry.
Amazing food complimented with an array of rich tasting wines.
Please visit you will not be disappointed."
Positive,1,exilentDelicious food and wine. Recomended if your in Rome. Best meal we've had during our visit. Meet up hungry
Positive,1,Excellent!!The food here is amazing! Yes it's a little pricey but as it's fine dining it's worth it. And you get a lot of food for your money unlike some fine dining places. There's a few tasting menu options (one dedicated to truffles!) Or you can order each course from the normal menu. Servers were all really friendly and can help choose the wine (there is a huge book to choice from!) And there's a few little nice surprises as well just to top off the experience. Would recommend to go when you've plenty time to enjoy each course and the atmosphere.
Positive,1,"Unbelievable food - fantastic service!Ad Hoc was an amazing experience from start to finish - I booked this reservation a few weeks ahead of a family trip to Rome after reading some mommy blog that said it was kid friendly (I would say 12+) wine bar. I e-mailed the restaurant to alert them to an allergy that my step sons have and when we arrived, everyone was aware of the allergy and they extremely accommodating with the menu and the service was great throughout dinner. Now, on to the food - unbelievable! I knew I loved truffle, but this was beyond my expectations - truffle EVERYTHING, you can literally have everything on the menu with truffle. I loved the truffle so much that I even tried to make another reservation for a free night we had a few days later, but unfortunately they were fully booked. I can't say enough great things, the staff was great, the restaurant itself was beautiful, the wine selection was excellent and the food was amazing!"
Positive,1,"Superb cuisine featuring truffles every nightWhat a find! This restaurant vastly exceeded our expectations.  Superb food, friendly and helpful staff, and a massive wine list.  Sommelier was terrific in helping us make a great, reasonably priced selection."
Positive,1,"Absolutely fantastic!!I booked this restaurant as part of my girlfriends 30th birthday several months before heading to Rome based on a lot of the reviews below, and I am so happy that I did! 

Upon arrival we were greeted by a lovely waitress who showed us to our table and took our jackets. A few minutes later two glasses of prosecco arrived at the table which was a lovely touch. There is an extensive wine list by the glass or bottle and we opted for a glass of wine each (then another 2 more after our mains)

There are several options for dinner, such as the tasting menus, with or without paired wines as well as a tasting menu with  or without truffles for those who fancy something slightly different. 

We went for the Ad Hoc tasting of starters - beef tartare, roulade with prosciutto and buffalo cheese, and pumpkin blossom with ricotta and basil and they were all very tasty! 

We opted for a selection of mains (where you can try two different mains but as a smaller portion) I went for Seabass rolled in zucchini and beef cheek, and my girlfriend went for suckling pig and breaded cod fish. We were very happy with our choices as they were so very tasty and the portion size was just right. 

Upon requesting the bill, the waitress said she would be a few minutes. Upon her return she cam back with a chocolate and cream dessert with a candle in it singing happy birthday  - much to the embarrassment of my girlfriend! It was a lovely touch by the waitress/restaurant. 

I cannot fault this place at all - superb wine list, incredible food and fantastic hospitality! I would definitely recommend making a reservation and nex time I am back in Rome will definitely be heading back"
Positive,1,Tour of the Coliseum and VaticanMy wife and I dined at Ad Hoc in Feb.  We are from Northern California and have dined at several of the Michelin starred restaurants in Napa Valley. Our experience at Ad Hoc with both service and food rivaled any of the restaurants we have dined at in Napa Valley. I highly recommend Ad Hoc.
Positive,1,"Best restaurant in RomeMy girlfriend and I have been in Rome at several occasions and this restaurant is by far the best we have been at. Great atmosphere, tasty menus and outstanding service."
Positive,1,The best meal I had in my 12 days Italy trip!I still remember the scents of truffles when the first dish arrived! The truffle set with wine pairing is highly recommended as the truffles are so fresh and match with the dishes! Personnally I prefer the carbonara most! The pasta is well cooked with cheese and the truffles still stand out! The wine pairing is good too and served by knowledgeable staff. The price is fair considering the food quality and the overall dining experience. I'd love to come back if there is a chance :)
Positive,1,A bilingual beautyWe had a fantastic evening in Ad Hoc when we last visited Rome at the end of February.  The waitress even indulged my pathetic attempts at Italian and gave me both menus so i could cheat if needed!  The food is really lovely here - very imaginatively presented.  We didn't go with the tasting menu but chose from the a la carte which had something for everyone. The complimentary prosecco on arrival was a lovely touch and we got some great tips for our wine selection.  The service was extremely professional but warm at the same time. The bill was very reasonable for the quality and overall experience.  The gift of a bottle of olive oil when we left was a big but very welcome surprise.  You should try this restaurant!
Positive,1,"Definitely high endI'm sure they are aiming for a Michelin star. But they still have a way to go. Nice staff even when they are busy. Had a tasting menu with wine included which gave us starters, a selection of pastas. Excellent. Pork and fish for mail course. Interesting and nicely presented. Absolutely worth trying if you want something else than the pizza/pasta places. Fair price too  EUR 85."
Positive,1,"One of the best in Rome!Wow - superb restaurant!

Truffle dishes are a must, we didn’t opt for a tasting menu and instead we tried a few pasta dishes and highly recommend them. 

Service was fantastic, very knowledgable with explaining the truffles and wider menu.

It was a celebratory dinner for birthday and they very kindly brought dessert with a candle which was a lovely surprise!

Great ambience - see the photos. 
A gem of a restaurant and I highly recommend it!"
Positive,1,"Great food, fun and attentive staff - Great experience!My partner and I read about Ad Hoc and decided to try it. We had the tasking menu and were not disappointed. We've tried many fantastic restaurants in Rome. This one is up - not only the food was fantastic but the whole experience. The staff was fantastic and brought also some fun to our experience. Thank you Massimiliano and team! We will be back for sure. Thomas & Murillo"
Positive,1,"Perfect restaurant for birthday dinnerStylish, gastronomic restaurant. Food is really delicious, very good and friendly service. I recommend to try something from truffle menu"
Positive,1,If I could give 6 stars I would!We tried 2 of the tasting menus with wine. All of the food was excellent and we were absolutely full at the end. The wine pairings suited perfectly and the whole tasting menu was well priced. It was our 10th wedding anniversary and all of the staff made a special effort - a truly memorable evening. If you are visiting Rome this is definitely a place to add to your itinerary.  Thanks to all of the staff - you have left us with a lovely memory.
Positive,1,"FantasticLoved the truffle options. have eaten here twice in the past year and we loved each meal. The service is really nice and the atmosphere is right there. The truffle tartare, beef ravioli (with truffle), and suckling pig were our favorites."
Positive,1,"Excellent meal!!! Will return.What a meal, food was superb and the service impeccable. Next time in Rome will definitely return. Oh, try the Truffle taster menu."
Positive,1,"Beyond superb!Everyone there could not have been nicer!  Food was divine, lots of tastes and samples. It was out last night in Rome and the perfect send off. Do not miss this place and experience- absolutely loved it!!!"
Positive,1,"ExcellentDelightful experience, excellent food and great service. The attention to detail was second to none!  Make sure you pay a visit when in Rome."
Positive,1,"A wonderful eveningWe visited here on a trip to Rome, celebrating a seventieth birthday. After researching various restaurants I found Ad Hoc and there was something about the name that caught my attention. What a joy!
We were warmly welcomed, given time to enjoy a complimentary glass of fizz before being offered the menu which was explained in such a professional yet friendly manner. No rush whatsoever. Then the wine menu...sheer delight. The sommelier arrived to help with an ultimate decision, then the food arrived. Sheer bliss....you have to experience the delicate flavours, wonderful presentation and timely intervals for yourself.
Finally, delightful little delicacies to compliment what had been a truly excellent meal.
Well done Ad Hoc....you are wonderful!"
Positive,1,"SuperbVisited this restaurant during a weekend trip to Rome. From the moment we booked via email to the night of our meal the customer service was superb. One of our party was celiac and this was not an issue for the restaurant in fact they went out if their way to help. Service first class and the menu and food quality was amazing.so good in fact that we tried to get a reservation for the following night but it was fully booked . I had the fish based tasting menu which was stunning. 
This is one of the best restaurants I have eaten in anywhere in the world"
Positive,1,Weekend in RomeVery nice restaurant and cosy atmosphere. Maybe the best that we visited in Rome. We booked through the internet and the response was prompt and accurate.  The service was very good
Positive,1,"Fantastic experience at all levels!I cannot be more pleased to have visited this restaurant. It was our last day in Rome to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and exceeded all the expectations.

Everything was just perfect from the moment we walked in, very friendly, professional and knowledgeable staff, beautiful and cosy interior. We had a lovely table by the window, it's a small space but somehow everything is laid out so that you still retain your privacy.

And the food was top class, we had 2 different tasting menus with wines. The portions were generous and had variety of different tastes within one plate. Food and Wines were served at the same time, no waiting or missing orders. Again top marks.

Their attention to detail is amazing, I booked the Birthday dinner about month and a half before as a surprise and to top it all off, they brought dessert in with a little candle singing happy birthday! I didn't think they would remember.

All in all I cannot rate it high enough. Highly recommended, good value for money and you leave the place with a smile on a face! Will visit again when back in Rome."
Positive,1,Amazing experience! Food...wow!We are so glad we visited here on our last night in Rome. The staff were lovely and the food...just amazing! Highly recommend!

Positive,1,"Excellent choice fo rdinnerBusy restaurant so best to reserve a table for dinner.  Very friendly and helpful staff with good English.  A relaxed atmosphere, welcoming glass of Prosecco provided.  A wide range of wines by the glass available.  Nice choices on the menu, dishes cooked and presented really well with attention to detail and high quality ingredients. Truffles are a speciality of the restaurant.  The most enjoyable dinner we had during our stay in Rome, highly recommended."
Positive,1,"Lovely EveningWe had our best meal whilst in Rome at this restaurant. The interior is beautiful - like being inside a wine cellar, with an extensive wine menu to match! The staff were very friendly and extremely knowledgeable. The food was lovely, and with it being my birthday, they put a candle in dessert and sang happy birthday, which was a nice touch. All in all, beautiful restaurant with great food and friendly staff - a must visit whilst in Rome, particularly if it's a special occasion!"
Positive,1,"Still fantastic!We visited Ad Hoc restaurant four years ago with friends and had a really fantastic meal and a very enjoyable night. We had said that if we ever got the chance to return to Rome we would also return to Ad Hoc.
This time we had the taster menu with wines. What a fabulous meal we had. Each course was full,of flavour and the wines were really great. The only criticism of our meal is that the portions were quite large and by desert we were overly full. Not really a complaint!
If you are in Rome and want a really fantastic dinner, and are prepared to spend a little above the average, then book a table at Ad Hoc. You will be glad you did!"
Positive,1,Excellent as always great mealWonderful evening out - service immaculate and food excellent- good choice of wines. Very good value for a restaurant of this class.
Positive,1,"Just fantasticNice interior, nice people,excellent menu, excellent service, lots of very good tastes, fantastic wine list (to much to choose, we ended up with Brunello Poggio Celsi 2012).
We will be back next time in Rome, - be sure!"
Positive,1,"Superb 20th Anniversary DinnerWent with the family to Rome to celebrate our 20th anniversary ( was a surprise for my wife) and I chose this restaurant for our celebratory dinner.

We had a great table at the back of the restaurant and the decor is very different to the UK, wine bottles everywhere and this made this a really nice change.

The food was really good, especially the trio of beef tartar which my 15 year old daughter loved....main courses had a good choice and portions are and acceptable size. Further I arranged in advance for a special dessert (no dairy as wife is lactose intolerant) and this was prepared and was lovely.

The service was great attentive but not obtrusive.

Overall an excellent experience, I can recommend this restaurant however it gets busy so an advance reservation will probably be required.

Lastly the owner sent us an electronic cook book to remember our experience and this was a really nice touch."
Positive,1,"Excellent experienceI had dinner on a Saturday evening, and was delighted by the welcoming service, the nice atmosphere/decor and the quality of the menu and wines. I particularly enjoy truffled dishes, so this was a great choice. Being in Rome for a weekend I was afraid of choosing a 'tourist trap' type of restaurant. Ad Hoc treats you very well from beginning to the end, and I left with a great feeling after an enjoyable Italian dining experience. Honestly, I would love to come back on my next trip to Rome. Work well done by the managers and team."
Positive,1,Highlight of the holidayThis is by far one of the best restaurants in Rome. Staff were friendly and attentive and the food was perfect in every way.
Positive,1,"Fantastic food, service and wineAlways a clear favorite the food is the best I’ve had in Rome and service is professional and very friendly! The selections of wine is second to none and the interior has a lovely atmosphere. Offered small bottle of lovely olive oil as we left! We will always be back againz"
Positive,1,"Fantastic birthday meal!Came here with friends to celebrate my wifes birthday and wow....we had a fantastic time there. A lovely table at the top surrounded by wine! Food and service was superb. Little complimentary nibbles came out, and at the end the staff singing Happy Birthday to my wife with a beautiful birthday dessert which further added to our wonderful experience. Egma, our waitress was wonderful, she was very friendly and helpful especially when helping to choose some bubbles and at the end on leaving the ladies in our party where present with a little gift. Overall, a wonderful place!"
Positive,1,Absolutely fabulousWhat a stunning find in the centre of Rome. Staff were so thoughtful and kind with great knowledge of the menu and wine list. Food was stunning and different. Wine list was amazing. Will definitely be back and would highly recommend.
Positive,1,"The best meal we had in Rome.This place is legit.  Its a traditional Italian meal, so expect to be there for three luxurious hours.  The food and wine kept coming and coming. There were truffles galore! I don't know what it is called in Italian, but they gave us a pre dessert, then dessert, then some kind of after dessert.  You will not be disappointed if you go here, but make sure you make reservations in advance."
Positive,1,"Perfect dinnerGreat dinner, the truffle menu is a must, but the rest is also excellent, We had the burrata with black truffle and some great pasta. We loved it and will go back as soon as we get to Rome again."
Positive,1,"SuperbVisited in January with my partner. Both had the land tasting menu with wine pairing. Everything was faultless. The food, wine, service and ambience. A very special evening. Thanks you."
Positive,1,"Absolutely LovelyGorgeous meal, gorgeous wine, would definitely recommend! Especially if you’re a truffle fan! Staff were lovely and spoke terrific English! The wine menu is the biggest I’ve ever seen! Options of tasting menus and a la carte what more could you want!"
Positive,1,"Unbelievable experienceAmazing experience in Rome.
Lovely restaurant in the heart of the city. 
Cool dishes and superb truffles.
I have been with my family and a couple of friends and we paid around 73€ per couple.
Super.
We will be back for sure"
Positive,1,"our best food experience in Roma - truffles delightFrom service to decor Everything was perfect we could taste various masterpiece of the menu with truffles, delicious and generous. For 70€ for two we had an amazing diner remarkable quality for price. we had lovely bottle of olive oil as a gift at the end. A must go!"
Positive,1,"Ad HocEverything was perfect. The warm welcome when we arrived . The restaurant was cozy and we felt very comfortable. I liked the concept of the restaurant in which you find walls of bottles of wines . The food was very delicious and tasty. The staff was very friendly .
At the end we had gifts for everyone : small bottles of house Olive Oil.
We really appreciate the good service of Adhoc and we had an amazing dinner time."
Positive,1,"The perfect celebrationI had searched through many restaurants for my husband's perfect birthday dinner.  When we arrived in Rome our concierge said that we should enjoy Ad Hoc but it wasn't necessarily a celebration venue.  I completely disagree!  The small, intimate restaurant designed its seating so that there is more privacy in certain sections than at many Roman restaurants.  The wine bottles lining the room make one feel like you have been invited to dine in a family's private cellar.  For fans of truffles, that is their speciality, and they do no it well.  The carbonara cubo was so good that my husband stole it and left me with his pasta course, which fortunately for me, was also excellent.  The lamb dish on special was exquisite, but the beef cheeks were also a magnificent choice.  My husband was also touched that the chef did also gift him with a special dessert in honour of his birthday.  The restaurant is on a quiet street and is completely walkable from several fine hotels, and it was open on a Sunday."
Positive,1,"A Dining HighlightThis was a wonderful dining experience. Upon arrival, we were shown to a private booth for our family of four and offered a complimentary glass of prosecco.  While the multi-course meal was delicious, what we appreciated most was how the staff bent over backward to accommodate our daughter, who is vegan. It's not easy finding vegan meals in Rome (aside from the ubiquitous past in red sauce), but here the chef offered numerous options for her and she loved them all (and the rest of us loved our cheese and meat courses). To top off this very satisfying meal, we were each offered a small bottle of olive oil as a parting gift.  Prices were very reasonable as well. It was a memorable experience and we will be sure to visit Ad Hoc on future trips to Rome."
Positive,1,"Amazing DinnerWe decided to go with the taster menu and absolutely loved it. The waiters were proffessional, the sommelier made our night and the food was perfect. we will definitely go back again. If you want an amazing meal in an intimate atmosphere, then AD HOC is the place to go."
Positive,1,"Wonderful food and a warm welcomeA gastronomic delight and the staff worked well with our party of 14 who were in Rome for the rugby and catching up with each other for the first time in a while.  We were fairly loud for such a sophisticated restaurant but the staff were accommodating.  Most of the party had one of the tasting menus and the food was extremely tasty, the helpings defeated some of the party and the wine choices complimented each course.  I hope we get the chance to return in a couple of years but maybe I should ask for a private room."
Positive,1,"50th birthday dinner oh so worth itDined here in January for my 50th birthday. The service is wonderful, made to feel very special. Excellent use of truffles, food is fresh and portion sizes are very generous. Highly recommended. In fact the food in Rome is sublime.. and extremely reasonable"
Positive,1,"A cozy but classy treat! Wine-lovers' heaven!We had dinner at Ad Hoc on New Years Day 2019. After a warm welcome (and a cool bubbly welcome drink) we were told that in this restaurant there is no RUSH. Even though the restaurant was almost full, we experienced a sense of tranquility and waiters were not 'pushing' you to order or to clear a table. To call the wine list 'extensive' is an understatement: it's (Trump-voice) HUGE! The staff have excellent knowledge of wine, grappa etc. At midnight was the birthday of my partner and the Ad Hoc team made it a special moment in a classy way! The spaces are cozy, wine bottles are wall-to-ceiling and the decor is simple yet elegant but COZY. The food was good but what really makes Ad Hoc stand out is the EXPERIENCE. From start to finish: a treat. Highly recommended."
Positive,1,"Amazing dinnerMy wife and I visited ""Ad hoc"" in November 2018 and had a great time during our dinner there! The enviroment was unique, the staff was really polite and helpful and, of course, the food was fantastic, just like the wine! One of our best moments in Rome, and a place that we would love to visit again!"
Positive,1,"Amazing End to Our Italian HoneymoonMy wife and I took a 2 week honeymoon to Italy that started the day after we got married. We enjoyed meals in Como, Venice, Florence and Rome with our very last meal being at Ad Hoc. WHAT AN EXPERIENCE IT WAS! We were greeted by incredibly friendly staff and the rest of the dining experience was as wonderful as two honeymooners could ever ask for. We were sat at a window-side table where we could watch people passing by and admiring the beauty of the decor inside the restaurant. It made us feel very fancy! We were pleasantly assisted in selecting one of the best wines we had during our entire honeymoon trip. Then we proceeded to enjoy one of the best meals of the trip as well! Not only was the food extremely delicious but the ambiance, the welcoming staff and the surprise ""Happy Honeymoon!"" dessert plate at the end really made it nothing short of a special and memorable meal. I could not have been more pleased in the fact that I decided on Ad Hoc for our last meal in Italy - it only left us that much more excited to return some day. Thank you to everyone who played a role in our experience here - it was delightful!"
Positive,1,"Dinner at Ad HocWonderful restaurant, the location, the atmosphere and the very professional and friendly staff make the whole dinner experience memorable. Food was delicious specialities from the Roman kitchen very tasty and beautifully presented, the wine and the Prosecco were outstanding too. A lovely recommendable address."
Positive,1,"Best Restaurant in RomeBest restaurant in Rome and one of the best italian restaurants in the world. We ate the best carbonara in the universe. Great staff and very nice atmosphere, we will definitely come back everytime we come to Rome."
Positive,1,"Stunningly Restaurant and Hospitality to match the exquisite foodMy wife and I decided to visit this restaurant while Rome recently based on Trip Advisor reviews. We weren’t disappointed.
Far from your typical “tourist like” Pasta/Pizza Restaurant Ad Hoc was a culinary experience and from the moment we arrived you could tell they understood quality and making the customer feel welcome. It was anight to remember and finished with the lovely small touch of a gift of Petit deserts and a small bottle of Extra Virgin olive oil to take home.
As a Coeliac they were more than accommodating with Gluten Free options.
Such a great restataurant and experience that I would highly recommend for anyone wanting a great evening. Keep up the great work."
Positive,1,"A wonderful dinner in a very cool looking restaurant.My daughter and I both had a wonderful dinner.  

The restaurant itself was very cute and fun looking.  The service attentive, but not pushy.  We did the one of the tasting menus and found that each course was well prepared.  The menu had a nice selection of both tasting and à la carte.  If you enjoy truffles, there were many dishes that featured them.

The price point was actually a very good deal for the quality of the food.

All and all a very cool place.  I will come back next time I am Rome."
Positive,1,"Charming Wine RestaurantA charming and intimate restaurant. Excellent food and service. Of course wine is a star, and they have an outstanding curated list of wines. Lovers of Italian wine, this is your place.

We very much enjoyed our dinner and look forward to returning."
Positive,1,"The best restaurant in Rome!I am not used to leave reviews but this time I have to. We are amazed with everything regarding this restaurant. Definitely staff is very professional and so kind. Food is very tasty and cook is real virtuoso. 
Also we are astonished with many things we got for free. 
I will recommend this place to my friends, and I know for sure where we will eat next time in Rome 😁
Ad Hoc, just keep going 👍🏿"
Positive,1,"Superb! Our best dining experience in RomeMy family and I went to Ad Hoc restaurant on Christmas Day, during our visit to Rome and had a superb experience, starting with the 201-page red wine menu , the truffle-themed dishes and the excellent service and recommendations. I should add that as a gluten-intolerant person, I had no problem having the dishes I wanted adapted. I can highly recommend the zucchini flowers, the pasta with black truffle and the Casanova Brunello di Montalcino wine. We also got small bottles of olive oil as a good-bye gift and an electronic cookbook with some of their tasty Italian recipes. Can't wait to go back!"
Positive,1,"Nice restaurant near to Piazza PopoloWe spend our new year's eve in the restaurant. I get the fish menu with wine. The food was really delicious, the service professional. We have to come back again. Remind to book a table! Highly recommended."
Positive,1,"A great memorable experience in the heart of RomeThis restaurant was recommended to us by a number of friends and we got lucky to find a table on our second visit to Rome.

We were very looking forward to our visit to celebrate my husband's birthday and get to share this experience on such a special occassion.

We were welcomed by the door and the restaurant decor was also very welcoming, we were shown our table on the side as requested and we were given the menus. We have opted for the black truffle tasting menu and they have accomodated me with my dietary requirements. The food was exquisite from beginning to end and the service was impeccible. At the end, we were given a nice bottle of wine and olive oil. 

This has been a very nice experience to treasure and we are very pleased to have celebrated this occassion at your restaurant. Thank you to all the staff at Ad Hoc!"
Positive,1,"Yummy food and great atmosphere!My husband and I visited this restaurant on our trip. Real gem and definitely 'must go'!Everything was near perfection,very knowledgeable and attentive staff,amazing vine selection and food just perfect. We'll be back!"
Positive,1,"This is a jewel of a restaurant in ROMEIf I thought the food menu was impressive, wait until you see the wine menu, it is the most comprehensive I have ever enjoyed. The food at Ad Hoc is amazing, every mouthful with great flavour. The atmosphere inside is relaxed, the walls decorated with wine bottles, and the special professional and polite with great explanation of the food & wine pairings. 

This was restaurant was recommended to me by a good friend and I would recommend this to anyone. It is a hidden jewel within Roma."
Positive,1,"Highly recommendAfter seeing the reviews for this restaurant we booked for the last night of our holidays as a treat , we weren’t disappointed . Friendly , attentive staff , our waitress was very knowledgable about the food and the extensive wine selection and we were happy to follow her recommendations . All three courses were gorgeous and there was lovely little complimentary treats in between . At the end of the night I was given a little bag with a small bottle of olive oil to take home which was a nice touch . It was a wonderful, relaxed night in a cosy warm restaurant and I would recommend it to anyone . The only thing we both would have changed is that our table for two was tucked behind a wall. There was a table for six the in the ‘corridor ‘ area too and until that was filled we felt cut off from the rest of the restaurant"
Positive,1,"Excellence! For everybody!Cordiality, professionalism, excellent wine selection (recommendation), the best meal of our trip to Italy, for a fair price! Definitely a 'must go' when you visit Rome."
Positive,1,"Great food, fantastic location!We enjoyed our diner in the Ristorante Ad Hoc immensely! The food itself was great, the wines superb and the service fantastic. Greatly recommended for everyone visiting Rome."
Positive,1,"Wonderful View! Lovely PlaceYou will love this place. Totally Italiano! Great food, great wine. Great prices! Wonderful customer service. We felt like family."
Positive,1,"Excellent food and wine selectionVery professional staff, courtesy and excellent customer care. I had some tartare for appetizer and lamb as a second. Delicious. Very good selection of wines and olives oil ... price is not cheap but it is justified by the environment, the location and the quality of the food. Suggested."
Positive,1,"Husbands 50th BirthdayWe were recommended by a friend and were happy with the whole experience. Lovely quirky venue - surrounded by wine bottles !!  Great service - the waitress explained all of the courses which were all amazing. And they surprised my husband at the end of the meal with a 50th Birthday dessert whilst the whole restaurant sang
Happy Birthday which was lovely. Would definitely recommend this restaurant."
Positive,1,"Tasting menus a good optionto try many things (Roman and Sea), although we thought they could have smaller portion sizes as we did not show self control on the early courses and it was a lot to eat. Good service!"
Positive,1,"Worth every dime !!The place is magical. Food, wine, staff, location, ambience- everything exceeds the expectations.... perfect choice for spending a nice evening with your sweetheart. The enitre menu is designed to  raise your temptation and leave you wanting for more. Extensive wine list to match with every dish and staff’s warmth is the icing on the cake.
Lovely place, deserves all 5 stars 😊😊"
Positive,1,"Xmas eve dinnerAll the staff was very friendly, we enjoyed our dinner lot..the plates with the truffle are excellent choices!we enjoyed our bottle of wine suggested by the dear staff!
Thank you!"
Positive,1,"One of the best in RomeVery nice, cozy and warm. You are going to have a gourmet experience surrounded by a wall of precious wine bottles. Great menu and service. The price is high and righ"
Positive,1,"Wonderful meal and experienceWe visited recently as a special dinner for my wife's 40tb birthday. The food was fantastic, we went for the tasting menu with the wine and all dishes were a reasonable size and we left feeling stuffed. Nice touches included the extra small dishes in between courses, mineral water, a glass of sparkling wine on arrival and a birthday message and candle for my wife. The witress also deserves a special mention for really good knowledge of all the food and wine and explanation of each when brought to the table (in english). Very pleasant restaurant environment with lovely ambience and perfect for a special occasion. Book online (very easy to do) for a discount, price reflects quality of restaurant. Highly recommend."
Positive,1,"Adhoc Restaurante, RomeWe went for dinner and I must say that we had a very pleasant evening. The staff were super, explaining the different dishes. The wine list, rather the wine ""book"" was a bit daunting. We just asked the waitress to advise us and her choice was excellent. At end of evening, guests were given a small bottle of olive oil, nice detail. The bill was fair considering the high quality of the restaurant. I would definitely recommend it. Best to book..."
Positive,1,Great tasting menu.I have been visiting rome for over 40 years (this fall for a month) and I was attacted to ad hoc because of the truffles. I decided on the tasting menu with wine parings. The meal was exceptional and the service very professional. It was also a very good value. I will return when in rome again in february.
Positive,1,"A unique restaurant Ad HocI really loved that restaurant.. the food was amazing, we were sourounded by wines and that made a unique atmosphere. The truffles smelled great and I couldn’t wait to taste the menu. At the end of the meal, once we paid the bill the gave us a gift. A bottle of virgin oil. That was a fabulous gesture!! Ad hoc I will definitely visit you again once I get back to Rome!!!"
Positive,1,"Best dinner in RomeLittle gem in central Rome. Highly recommend their truffle dishes, they also have a wide range selection of wine to pair with the dishes. From service to food to ambiance, everything is lovely. Would definitely go back again."
Positive,1,Birthday celebrationGreat small restaurant in central Rome. Walking distance from main shops and Spanish steps. Food excellent plus the opportunity to try various truffle specialities. Extensive wine list and helpful servce.
Positive,1,"Wonderful engagement diner.To cellebrate our engagement, my fiance had chosen to dine at Ad Hoc restaurant. The athmosphere was incredible. Everyone was amazingly kind and professionel. The food was spectacular and at Michelin star level. We had the white truffle menu, which was wonderful.
We enjoyed our evening very much and would like to go back.
Thank you all!"
Positive,1,"Best in RomeOutsatanding service, food and the wine service is one of a kind. All food served was fresh, as well as they probably have got one of the best winelist ever!"
Positive,1,"100% must visitThis place is just amazing! Excellent service, best cuisine. So many little things that made us feel special, as a guest. Thanks a lot, we will definitely come back to this charming place."
Positive,1,"A great restaurantThis is highly rated on Trip Advisor and other similar websites.  All of the praise is very well deserved.  It is a great place.  Food, wine, service, ambiance, curb appeal all tops.  Not all top rated places live up to their reputations but this one does.  Not to be missed"
Positive,1,"Wow!We had our 40th wedding anniversary dinner in this restaurant. And it was not bad choice at all! The whole set; service,local,atmosphare, food, wines...just the best quality. Ravioli beef& trufles was best pasta dish ever . In Rome you can find hundrets restaurants, but for sure Ad Hoc is one of the best. Next time we will be back 100%."
Positive,1,Lovely eveningFound this place on trip advisor and decided to give it a go. We was very lucky we got a table as we didn’t book (recommend making a reservation) and they managed to just squeeze us in. Food was lovely. Restaurant is gorgeous and romantic. Loved the glass of wine we received as soon as we sat down as well at the little desserts they bought us after the meal. We wasn’t going to order a dessert but let’s be fair we all have a little room for one if they are going to bring one over. Also the little bottle of olive oil was a lovely touch to take home
Positive,1,"ExcellentService was excellent, extreme attention to details. Great food. Nice location and warm setting. Highly recommend"
Positive,1,"A little dissapointedThis is the eighth time I have had dinner at Ad Hoc, so needless to say, I am a fan. But the dinner I had last night was a bit dissapointing. For 250 euro a couple for a prix fixe
Menu, You'd expect to be blown away, and honestly, I was not. 
I had the black truffle menu, usually a solid choice. We started off with slow service and an amuse bouch that was a tasteless spinach purée. The carbonara continues to be as good as it gets, but a lot of the truffles were flat and fairly weak. The wine pairings were good with 3 out of 4 being stunning. The wine steward is great and she took the time to explain all the selections. The rest of the food was okay, and the suckling pig was a winner. There were three rounds of deserts, but I was too stuffed to really plow through them. The prix fixe came with a conolli that was great, a pannacotta that was blah and a good tiramisu that has somehow become a standard on all Roman restaurant menus. 
Service was choppy and once the high rollers began ordering truly expensive wines, they garnered all the attention. It was just not the friendly and personal experience that I have been accustomed to, and the evening was a bit of a let down. 
Would I go back? That remains to be seen."
Positive,1,"WonderfulWe visited Ad Hoc for my wife’s birthday, from the moment we arrived to leaving we were looked after to highest standards by all of the staff. They were attentive, helpful and above all extremely knowledgable about there wine and food. The wine was great and the food with it’s attention to detail was truly wonderful. I can’t wait to go again and would highly recommend this restaurant to my friends and family."
Negative,0,"Awful and unfriendly serviceService took to long
We asked several time for a speedier service as we had to attend an event
When we ordered their speciality Pirogi and pork chops was not available, so a large part of their menu was not to be ordered 
When we wanted to pay separately we had a very aggressive waiter that didn’t want to do it making weird explanations.
The tone was very aggressive and almost a little bit physical.
He was totally not open to feedback.
We were all shocked and have a good story to tell to the other 150 delegates of the event.

But that is no problem because he doesn’t care as he explained to us that he is the best waiter in Warsaw.
Perhaps also in Poland.
Excuse me would have been a better reaction"
Negative,0,Unbelievable boring foodThe food was very tasteless. The meet was dry and felt like heated up with a micro owen. Embarrassing that the waiter gave a card and ask for recommendations in trip advisor. It’s very hard to understand their high recommendations. Don’t go there!!!
Negative,0,"Confirm then confirm then check again if booking here🤬Would love to of visited, however the place needs to seriously sort it's booking system.
We booked a table for Saturday night on the Thursday evening, then having read a previous review of somebody not getting their booking we revisited the place on Saturday morning/lunchtime to confirm our booking. We were told it was all fine and our name and number were in the book. Fast forward to Saturday evening and looking forward to a nice meal for our last night in Warsaw and upon arrival we were told, sorry you have no reservation and must have the day wrong and that it was for the Sunday. Pretty unlikely being as we fly home early Sunday and had confirmed the booking less than 12 hours earlier.
They need to have a hard look at their booking procedures if they are to avoid many more 1* disappointments😡"
Negative,0,"Ruined my birthdayWe made a reservation weeks ago, asking for a nice table because it would be my birthday.

When we arrived, three people rudely ‘welcomed’ us saying they were full and everything was reserved. My wife said she had a reservation and they looked at her as if she was lying. When she showed the reservation, the girl who had made it said it was a mistake and there was nothing she could do for us. We could come back the next day...

So we left and could ofcourse not find another nice restaurant, as it was Saturday evening and very busy in town.

What was supposed to be a special evening was ruined by the terrible ‘service’ of this restaurant."
Negative,0,"Mixed experienceIt was likely an off night - we were warned that the food would take about 30 min, but ended up waiting an hour for the mains. The beef tartare, deer roast and deer ragout were fine, not exceptional, but worth the price. At the end of the meal, my male partner was served a complimentary shot of vodka, while I (female) was offered a rose instead - come on, guys, we are in 21st century Europe..."
Negative,0,"Nice and lovely but somewhat disappointingOverall nice, but I wouldn't pick it again. The meat was nice (Veal and Duck, two dishes), but quite tasteless. Prices so so."
Negative,0,"Disappointing.With so many positive reviews, our expectations were too high.
The service wasn't exactly bad, but quite slow and unattentive. We were seated in the back, close to the restrooms.
We ordered boar, which was OK, but the garnish wasn't fresh.
When we paid, my partner got a complimentary drink (no word on what it was... Peach schnapps, maybe?) and I got a half-withered rose. They really didn't have to do that..."
Negative,0,":(Terrible service, bad food. We ate at Stary Dom the night before were everything was great, so this was a let down for us."
Negative,0,"Just okReading the recommendations of this restaurant, expectations were left much higher than the actual outcome.
Service and atmosphere was nice, but the food...not so great. Specially the chefs recommendation (roasted neef) was poor, wouldn't recommend it myself."
Negative,0,Good food but ripped off!!Clearly we don't speak or read polish and they added on an extra course which we didn't question (our stupidity) as it seemed such a nice place! So an extra 39zlt. Ok not much but still tarnished what was a great night! Food was great atmosphere amazing but just ripped off!! If you visit here and the bill doesn't add up! Question it!!
Negative,0,"poor touristy bad qualityService was awful and long, waitress discouraged our group of five to order and suggested it will be better if we leave just after the meat and cheese board was served. never again

almost forgot that received a margerita with salt"
Negative,0,"Good food, poor management.Nothing to complain about the food, but I feel we were not fairly treated; we booked (and received confirm) our table two weeks in advance, because restaurants tend to be pretty full during  pre-Christmas days. When we arrived we were offered a table in front of the bar, near the entrance door that, unlike most restaurants in winter,  had neither heavy curtains nor double doors to protect guests from cold gusts. Moreover, the door is saloon-like, so that whenever someone used it, we enjoyed a complimentary cold draft…! We asked to be moved to another free table inside the dining room, but they refused: that table remained empty for the whole evening, they only used it for laying the leftovers of the nearby large company.
The restaurant is also badly lit, with terrible energy-saving light bulbs (you could find better ones nowadays !)."
Negative,0,"I expected more regarding other visinom comentsI get burned dish, disappointing. The interior is pleasant and the waiters are fast but what we've come for is the food."
Negative,0,Pretty mediocrePretty mediocre. Having a hard time believing that this is one of the best restaurants in Warsaw. Was half empty on a Friday night and it was actually vacuumed during dinner.
Negative,0,"Very badWe went to the New Year's Eve dinner and the food was bad.
Acceptable appetizers even if they brought cold meatloaf, but maybe that's how they serve it in their countries.
But not the tuna flooded with soy sauce. It was very salty
Maybe we Italians are used to eating well."
Positive,1,"Simple food done exceptionally!One of our best finds in Warsaw! Simple polish-fare done extremely well.

Alek was a great host with great recommendations. Made us laughed and always feel attended to.

Cheesecake here was a banger and one of the best I ever had. This is a must try dish here at the restaurant.

Duck confit and the Shrimp Linguine are special shout-outs also!! Will recommend this restaurant to my friends and family."

Negative,0,"CHEAP BUT MEDIOCREGood location next to Fabergé museum which makes it very busy and crowded. Expect to wait for a table!
Restaurant is pleasant and waitresses delightful.
However, this restaurant which specializes in dumplings, from Italian raviolis to gioza, to Russian dumplings, etc, is quite low in quality! And the dumplings are mediocre, even though quite cheap:"
Negative,0,Poor service!They served me my dessert without one of the ingredients and when I asked they were quite rude about it. I asked if they could add the ingredient but they said they ran out. It was a key ingredient and the dessert was very bland and quite expensive without it. They wanted to offer me a 10% discount or I could return it. I ended up not getting the discount and they added an extra service charge to our bill. I guess as revenge for my complaint. My friends who were sitting at a separate table found glass in their food and did not receive the extra service charge... All in all very weird and the food was mediocre at best.
Negative,0,"Disappointing!I don't understand why people rave about this place.  Went here with two friends based on the tripadvisor rating, and all three of us were thoroughly disappointed!  We had pelmeni and varenniki with cherries.  The dough in both was way too thick and doughy, and while the cherry filling was good, the meat filling was mediocre.  I'm completely baffled!  I sure hope there are better dumpling places in St. Petersburg!"
Negative,0,"I don’t recommendPelmeni was normal like any other ordinary restaurant, waitresses totally careless, they were more busy with their cellphones, long waiting time to find table, very limited choice of food and beverages, no option to have cocktail drink , they offered me to do it by myself !!!!!!!! Weird"
Negative,0,"I was not allowed to speak!I did not even enter this restaurant. I will not comment the food as I have not tried it, but I believe a restaurant is not only food, but, mostly, service!

We tried to enter it on a Thursday evening, but the staff who was at the front door was extremely impolite! When I put my feet into the restaurant, I tried to ask if there was a table available, but before concluding my sentence, she wildly gestured that the restaurant was full. Okay, then I tried to ask her if we could wait for a table and how long that would take, but, once again, she did not allow me to conclude my sentence. She was not interested in new guests, afterall the place was full. Great way to welcome possible new guests.

If I could, I would give 0 (zero) star, but once that is not possible, I will give Pelmenya 1, like a 'thanks', because we then decided to go to Yat Restaurant and we had a fabulous dinner there."
Negative,0,"Not good as I expectedMany people recommend us to try Russian dumplings, and we chose here to have the experience of local food. Not many choices of food you can select. All is the same taste, I found it quite bored and bland. Not feel it is good."
Negative,0,"Awful serviceThis place is in the St.Petersburg center, near Anichkov bridge. While it has good reviews for the food, we didn't manage to try it. The service was awful. When we arrived, we just waited at the entrance - no one even bothered that we were there. Then a waitress approached and told us briefly ""wait"". Ok we thought, if she's so brief then it should be quick. After a while nothing changed - we were just standing at the entrance, making people which were eating feeling uncomfy. So we asked another waitress how long we need to wait? She replied 20 minutes at least. Could you tell us this information from the start? We immediately left the place.

My advice would be to eat there only if it's half empty and you don't have to wait at the entrance with no one caring about you. 
Otherwise please go further far from the center - you will find better and cheaper food places with cheerful stuff waiting to help you and make you feel welcome."
Negative,0,"Cheap food, cheaper taste.Service is awful and slow. If you order lunch, might as well prepare to eat it by dinner. 
What about the food, though? They only have manti, khinkali and others from the same line of ""food thinking"". So are they specialized? Far from it. The taste is as blend as a fruit smoothie, the dough from the khinkali came partially raw and, apparently, they have quite a lot of oil to use in their food. Besides being fried (you expect it to be partially crunchy), the khinkali came soft and mushy. The taste of the filling is overpowering and strong enough to the point you can barely eat more than one fork of it.
The aperitifs, though, seems to be much better, as the ""Mozzarella with tomatoes and basil"" came as good as you could expect for the price range (besides being quite oily as well).
They are not ""internationally ready"" as the drinks menu, sometimes, has no english translation and the staff had a hard time understanding me and communicating, resulting in one dish coming wrongly. They are quite friendly and try their best, though. Had no problem changing the dish without additional charges.
Have I mentioned that even the dessert is oily? This place should watch out as Trump may give them some ""freedom"" for the oil.

For an almost 5 star rating restaurant on Trip Advisor, the fame might have overpowered them and the food quality came low as fast as the ratings went high. Or the peoples food taste is just dubitable.
Would I recommend? Not even if you have no money to eat, there are better (and healthier, considering the amount of oil they use here) fast foods and bakeries for the same price range. Would I come back? Unless I need to fry some potatoes with my blood afterwards, nop.

Oh and should I warn you: the beer is warmer than my bath water."
Negative,0,"Worst service ever️️️we arrived at 22h, the restaurant closes at 23h, they kept pushing me and ️my boyfriend to choose fast, ️And since the menu has no clear explanations about each kind of dumpling ️️️we were looking online To decide.

Negative,0,"Not recommendI would recommend you to try dumpling in Hong Kong or China instead, although the filling is juicy. 
Pelmeni is absolutely fine unless you don't want yogurt-taste dressing for dumplings."
Positive,1,"Simply delicious!Great and warm welcoming,  vast variety, and delicious fresh flavors. Loved it! 

They also gave me a piece of gum! Gotta love it here."
Positive,1,"Dumplings!so many varieties of dumplings! and all very good. I wish I had gone with a group of people so I could try them all. waitresses speak some English, and an English menu is available. I plan to go back again before my trip is over"
Positive,1,LeisureTasty vareniky and pelmeni! Good location to Faberge museum.Quick service. Friendly staff and good for quick dinner with beer
Positive,1,Delicious dumplings!There are a variety of different delicious dumplings! The pelmeni were delicious and better than most we have eaten. We were introduced to boiled Khinikali and Khanum which were delicious. The prices are very reasonable and the service is friendly and helpful. It was all in all a great experience. We ate there twice and will return when we return to St Petersburg!
Positive,1,"Many kinds of delicious dumplingsThis is a cool but small restaurant that offers many types of delicious dumplings. We mostly had the Russian-style dumplings and they were all quite good. They offer sampler platters that allow you to try all the fillings for each type. The price was reasonable and the wait staff was friendly if a little slow. Overall, a good restaurant with very good food."
Positive,1,Interesting fusion of different dumplings from various regionsCheap and good dumplings. English menus available. I liked the khinkali which reminded me of shanghai soup pork dumplings
Positive,1,"delicious and affordableWe went to this restaurant for lunch and were not disappointed! We had to wait 5 minutes to get a table, they were very sweet and polite about it which I appreciated.

We ordered two beers, 20 pelmeni and 7 khinkali.  It was way too much food for two! The pelmeni were delicious, we both loved them.  Probably the best we had in Russia.  The khinkali were excellent too, they were very juicy inside and most enjoyable.

I would recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a great meal in a very nice locale for a great price."
Positive,1,"pelmeni and wareniki at it's best!We went there twice, it's so good! Everything is freshly made and just delicious! Authentic russian food, we loved all of the plates (yes, we almost tried everything:) This place is kids friendly and has a menu in English."
Positive,1,You don't have to like dumplings to enjoy eating here.Four of us ate here. We didn't have a reservation but this caused no problem. I don't like dumplings but was able to choose a lovely meal based on ravioli. The others all enjoyed their different varieties of dumplings.  The atmosphere was really relaxed and the bill was so cheap!
Positive,1,"great place to taste dumplingsIf you are dumpling-lover or are looking for to test those, this is the place to go. Small place with a dozen of tables, but we have never had an issue of waiting to get a place. Great variety of local dumplings. From Russian ones (vareniki), stuffed with mashed potatoes, young cheese, cottage cheese and cherries, to Asian style of dumplings. Very much affordable prices, fast service, great quality food. Having visited this place twice, I have no hesitation to give full credit to this place, which is half a block away from Nevski (main streed in StP). Enjoy"
Positive,1,"Good pelmeni and very cheapCheap food and beer. Simple place, with many pelmeni options, very nice service. Surely a great option in the city."
Positive,1,"The World is a DumplingThe best quality, freshly made dumplings restaurant I have ever
dined in. There 9 different types (Russian, Siberian, Uzbek, Caucausus, Japanese, Chinese, Italian, etc.) of dumplings from the Russian Union and elsewhere. All made on premises and individually cooked. That is why it can take 15 to
25 minutes to cook each course. Authentic drinks from all of Russia. Try the Kvas, made from fermented bread. So refreshing!"
Positive,1,"DinnerWe came without reservation - 3 persons. The restaurant was full, but it took us no more than 10 min to wait. Perfect offer of different types of pelmens with different inputs. And total of the bill was really surprising :)"
Positive,1,"Good food , cheap placeWent there for dinner around 7.. We sat immediately and got served quite quickly. Had a different range of dumplings ( all delicious ) from Russia, asia , and ex soviet countries. Cheap price, quick service and tasty food!"
Positive,1,"Good price for good foodNice place, simple and cozy. Not expensive way to try traditional Russian dumplings:) Good location in one of old buildings, close to the Fontanka river. It is also a good option for cheap and fast business lunch."
Positive,1,"Utterly wonderfulBeautiful concept, great food, lovely atmosphere, fantastic prices. 
Really is amazing how different cultures interpret the same concept :)
Apart from the pelmeni/dim sum/raviolli etc, the soups are excellent!
We tried the fresh vegetable platter & it was simply divine - large portion, fresh veggies, three delicious sauces; the pumpkin & carrot manti were sumptuous, the mushroom hanoum were impeccable and the tea was great :)

Fantastic food for a fantastic price!

Extra kudos for a great selection of portion sizes!"
Positive,1,"Great restaurant, well worth a visitWe have been a couple of times,  the food is delicious, the staff lovely and really helpful and the price is very reasonable. Totally recommend this place."
Positive,1,"Different kinds of tasty dough with meatGreat service. Different global ways to serve dimsum / piroshky or any other kind of this amazing food. 
Simple but great"
Positive,1,"Nice concept restaurant around dumplingsYou can try different kinds of dumpling as ravioli, dim sum, pelmeni, varenicle, and so on, some are better some less , it depends on your taste. Service is good , the only strange thing was that they did not want to split payment to more than two"
Positive,1,"Excellent traditional Russian pelmini, nice setting, friendly and helpful staff, good beerA Russian friend helped us select a selection of different pelmini, some with vegetables, some with lamb. Delicious, good beer, reasonable prices, nice environment. We had to wait for seating, but they told us a table would soon be free and the wait was not long.

I accidentally left my Russian-English dictionary and notebook, and when I returned the next day the staff had carefully saved it for me!"
Positive,1,"Absolutely super!They advertise Mono cuisine' though they do offer a few things beyond dumplings. But why would you want anything else? The dumplings are superb.. We were in St P eight days and went in three times. Service, atmosphere, food...not to be missed."
Positive,1,"Big choice of the national food like Russian pelmeny from different countriesYou can find Russian pelmeny and vareniky , Italian ravioli, Uzbek manty and hanum, Japanese Hedza and dim-Sam, Georgian hinkali. Very good service, friendly atmosphere, grate prices. Placed near to Faberje Museum."
Positive,1,"Best place to eat in SPBCozy, friendly and very delicious place to visit in SPB. I was really impressed with food and service that is in a top level. Moreover, one of the biggest advantage is relatively low price in the heart of Nevsky street.

100% recommend 
Best price. Very good food. Nice service."
Positive,1,"Wonderful restaurant!Very nice restaurant, relaxed atmosphere, extremely nice staff and delicious food! Menu in both russian and english, and staff will gladly answer questions about it. Free WiFi as well, not sure what more one could wish for!"
Positive,1,"One of the favorite Russian dishes.One of the favorite Russian dishes.In the heart of the city near the Circus and the engineer castle,Nevsky Avenue near you with appetite to eat dumplings. I personally eat with pleasure!"
Positive,1,Great asian style Dim sumThis place has 'dumplings' from all over the world and between the 4 of us we tried most of them! They were all really tasty and at very reasonable prices. We had to wait about 25 minutes for one dish which was a shame. Apart from that it was great!
Positive,1,"Great Place to ImpresssMy boyfriends' family was visiting from Kirov so we decided to try this place based on other reviews and being so conveniently located. 

I was iffy about their salmon pumpkin soup and assorted Asian dumplings, but I can be picky about that.

The varinkey, pelmeni, and all other dumplings were huge and delicious. We were stuffed! 

Four people and a bottle of wine, the total was about 3500p. 
Great price and a great relaxing evening!"
Positive,1,"Great atmosphere and great service!Me and my girlfriend popped in here after wandering around at Petersburg all day. I had read some reviews on it before we came to Russia and felt it would be a good spot to try. We were both very impressed. The girl who greeted us was super friendly and got us an English menu when we stumbled with our non existent Russian. She was very helpful, walked us through all the different dumplings on the menu, showing us pictures on her iPad and making some recommendations. We tried a few different styles; Russian, Uzbek and Georgian and a vegetable platter. All dishes were excellent, dumplings came out hot and fresh! Super flavourful stuff. The restaurant itself is a couple hundred metres off Nevsky but it has a great relaxed atmosphere, soothing jazzy music and cozy decor. We would absolutely recommend this place to anyone, especially any non Russian tourists who are looking for a less intimidating place to have a nice meal. They were very welcoming!"
Positive,1,"Global Dumpling selectionI was staying at the Radisson on Nevsky and saw that this was close and had good ratings, so I tried it.  I had no idea on the different kinds of dumplings (except Japanese & Chinese), and my waitress spoke excellent English and was very knowledgeable/helpful.  The prices were really reasonable, so I tried 4 different ones, even though I knew it would be too much food. I really wanted to try the different tastes and textures of fried, steamed, and combinations.  Became a huge fan of the Uzbek. Khanum after eating here."
Positive,1,"Worth tryingPretty good service. As a fan of dumplings, i would recommend you to have a try here. It provides different types of dumplings, including russian, italian, chinese and japanese style. I tried the khanum with eggplant. It was really good!!"
Positive,1,Very good.Good food. Not too expensive.  The Russian pilmeni are good and authentic. Prices are average. Also had the herring and potatoes and enjoyed.
Positive,1,"Nice Mid-range retaurantOne of the best pelmeni I have tried in the Baltic area. Nothing very complicated, nice modern decorations. Simple food choices, good quality, mid range prices. Close to the faberge museum, while waiting for a tour."
Positive,1,"Dumplings with good serviceAmazing selection of dumplings, and sated my Siberian craving for Pelmeni and Altai vodka!  Nice contemporary setting and fantastic service.  Savoury and sweet dumplings, and Grimbergen on tap.  Delicious.  Would it be too cheeky to ask for them to add Polish pierogies?"
Positive,1,"Dumpling-tastic!Extensive dumpling menu, all very well prepared. Service is excellent. 

Don't fancy dumplings, try elsewhere, but for their mono - cuisine you'll struggle to find better :-)"
Positive,1,"Great mono cuisine experienceGreat place for those who like or are willing to try traditional Russian food pelmeni (dumplings). Menu also contains all variations of dumplings from over the world: ravioli, dim sum, gyoza, vareniki, manti and khinkali. All of the dumplings are freshly handmade The fact that you can chose how many pieces you are getting in each serving allows to try a few different things in one go. Food is simple but delicious and great value for money.
Pleasant atmosphere, service is quick waiters are friendly and english speaking. Plus few wi-fi is available.
Defiantly going back next time I am in St. Pete:)"
Positive,1,Love these dumplingsI came here with my daughter and we just loved it. We devoured the vareniki with potato and the prawn gouza. Both were as fantastic as we make at home in australia.  We loved is much we came back on our last night in st petersburg
Positive,1,"Delectable Dumplings!Whilst I would not recommend this eatery for dinner, it makes a perfect pit stop for a hearty, cheap and filling lunch. No one should visit this part of the world without trying dumplings, meat or vegetables encased in an unleavened dough which are then boiled (and sometimes fried). They are a historic food staple and cherished part of the Russian and Central Asian diet. At Pelmenya you can experiment with a variety of dumplings including the famous Russian pelmeni, but also Ukrainian vareniki, Georgian khinkali, Uzbek manti, and also Chinese dim sum and Italian ravioli. 

We naturally tried pelmeni, resembling tortellini stuffed with ground beef and then boiled; vareniki, crescent shaped crimped parcels containing mashed potato and boiled;  khinkali, large purse shaped spicy dumplings stuffed with pork and beef, boiled and then fried that contain a mouthwatering savoury broth, and manti, containing spicy minced lamb that are boiled. Other fillings, both savoury and sweet, are available. Our choices came with a variety of condiments, including fried onions and sour cream, all except the khinkali which are supposed to be consumed plain and without the use of knives or forks; you should eat them with your hands leaving just the ‘stalk’ or ‘kudi’ of the dumpling where the pleats meet, which is tough. We particularly liked the fact that you could chose how many pieces of each dumpling to try (you’d want rather more pelmeni than khinkali), and the menu was in English as well as Russian. 

The waiting staff were very helpful and pleasant and spoke good English, the restaurant has a hip, modern vibe with free WiFi, although I would not want to sit for long on the high wooden chairs, opting instead for a more comfortable circular table. There are a variety of beverages on offer, but surprisingly, only one Russian beer – Baltica - which is a something of a shame as beer goes so well with dumplings and it would be nice to see this business supporting the growing Russian craft beer and ale scene."
Positive,1,"Interesting FindWe stayed not far from the restaurant, and found the great reviews of this place. We decided to try it ourself, and hey, it is a good place to try various kind of dumplings. We tried the Manti, Khinkali, Verenyky and their version of japanese Gyoza. My personal favorite was Khinkali, the Georgian dumplings, filled with meat and a bit of broth, just like the chinese's xiao long bao. The dumplings are quite big for Asian standard, so it is enough for both of us to order 3-5 pieces each menu."
Positive,1,"Simple dumplings for every tasteWhat an interesting concept. Dumplings from all over. We were at the end of a dreary day (weatherwise) and looking for warm full tummies. This menu did the trick. And for a good price.  The staff attentive,   willing to call for a taxi for the Russian challenged. It isn' t haute cuisine, not meant to be, but for a decent meal with no fuss, here is the place."
Positive,1,"Great place for dumpling loversGreat place with a quiet and pleasant atmosphere. There is a wide variety of dumplings available, boiled or fried, sweet and sour, and the service was fast and friendly."
Positive,1,"Good value for money!Russian food for a decent amount of money. Went there with friends, had some smaller dishes and drinks, it was a lot of fun and not expensive at all"
Positive,1,"Good qualityVery tasty food, good value for money, lovely atmosphere, good and fast service.  Most liked Chinkali, but all dumpling's lovers would find them mots desired."
Positive,1,"Lovely placeExcellent location, very friendly staff, very good Russian food and great value for money. Perfect for quick lunch."
Positive,1,High qualityI am a regular visitor here. Food is always fresh and pleasant here. Personnel is friendly. Always high quality of service.
Positive,1,"Great place and atmosphereThis is a tiny restaurant with one single dish (and its variations): dumplings. We were very well treated by the girls and  the food was very good. I highly recommend the Khinkalli, a Georgian dumpling. Cheers."
Positive,1,"Simply delicious !Pelmenya is a beautifully decorated restaurant located in the heart of St Petersburg tourist area. It serves delicious Russian, Georgian and Ukrainian food in a very relaxed atmosphere. Perfect after a long day of sightseeing. The staff is young and friendly. I had Georgian Khinkalis and it was just perfect. I had a very pleasant evening. Highly recommended !"
Positive,1,"Good ""mono cuisine"" restaurant!  If you like Russian pelmeni, this is the place for you.Very efficient restaurant.  Self seating, with quick attentive service.  The menu is pelmeni, pelmeni, pelmeni, but variations on that cuisine. I prefer the traditional meat pelmeni, but other fillings are also available. Two types of ""ook soose"" available!  I did think it...odd, that the paper place setting menu that lists the pelmeni choices and prices has a small disclaimer stating: ""This place setting is not the menu.""  You could have fooled me!"
Positive,1,"Pelmenya restaurant St PetersburgAn interesting menu, good service and a pleasant atmosphere.  But the main thing is the excellent value for money.  We returned twice during our visit to St Petersburg."
Positive,1,Great dumplings and ravioli!The dumplings were so good that we came back to this place three times during our visit! As an Italian I can certify that also the ravioli were excellent!
Positive,1,"For ""pelmeni"" loversThe place offers different kinds of ravioli, dim sum, gyoza, Russian, Ukranian and Georgian dumplings. 

We were served quickly and our dim sum and gyoza were delicious. The staff speak adequate English and they are very helpful.

We visited it in June and it was packed with people. The place is not very big, but if there are no spare tables ask the staff and they will tell you how to get to another ""Pelmenya"" which is bigger and is in 10-15 minutes' walk. 

All in all, a nice experience and hope to come back when in St. Petersburg."
Positive,1,Dumplings and beerIt's a typical quick bite cafe. The twist: it's all about dumplings. There are dumplings typical to East and West. Grab a Belgian draft and don't expect 5-star quality. Dinner for 2 with couple of drinks is 20 Euro. Free wi-fi and English menu are present.
Positive,1,"delicioussimple and delicious, you can try dumplings, from caucusus, siberia, many types, many fillings, tasty for reasonable price"
Positive,1,"Excellent pelmenys around the world!Really delicious pelmenys, khinkalis, mantis, dim sums... We tried almost everything on the menu and they were all just great! Excellent value for the money, cozy place and very friendly service. Big recommendation!"
Positive,1,"Shouldn't be visitedThis restaurant is one of ""monocuisines"" . It offers different kinds of dishes as italian raviolli.
As Russian, I could advice you to taste boiled beef ""pemeni"" with cream.
I eat japanese gedza but it was not the best. Vegetables were ok, but sauerkraut was not fresh, had a little smell. 
Anyway everything was ok, nice stuff and service."
Positive,1,"Well worth a visit to try these delicious Russian ""raviolis.""Our family love Pelmeni, Manti and Khinkali - the Russian, Uzbek and Georgian (respectively) take on ravioli.  We know how they're made, and we know when they're fresh and delicious.  This place was great.  Prepared just like they should be, nice casual atmosphere, friendly service, great value for money.  We stopped for a late lunch before visiting the Faberge museum.  I hope they don't get spoiled and touristy - this is a really super place, and the large number of locals will hopefully encourage them to keep up their standards."
Positive,1,"Pelmenya heaven!So glad we went here! We love russian food and especially Pelmeni which are just delicious here. The variety offers dumplings from all over the world. The atmosphere was nice and cozy and the staff was very friendly, spoke good English! Would definatly return."
Positive,1,"The perfect Russian dinnerWonderful service, fresh delicious traditional food. Best place we ate at here.  
Menu in Russian and English, great prints on the wall, calm place, freshly cooked pelmenis and varenikis."
Positive,1,Great food and super friendly staffThe menu is mostly dumplings - we liked the ones with mash potato inside. Quite a chill atmosphere and cool interior. Our waitresses were so lovely and friendly! Desserts were also yummy - especially the pistachio dessert.
Positive,1,"Delicious food I cozy placeWonderful food for very very reasonable prizes. Be early for diner if you don't have a reservation, because the place only has limited tables. Very cozy atmosphere and no rush. Definitely try the dim sum and khinkali and/or manti with lamb."
Positive,1,"Russian dumplings are the best!!!This is a small, casual and somewhat hip restaurant with awesome food and reasonable prices.  I had Pelmeni, cheese Varenyky and the awesome pumpkin and carrot Manti.   They have both a Russian and English version of their menu.  Best food I had in St. Petersburg."
Positive,1,"Great food and atmosphere!My family travelled to St Petersburg in July and prior to going I did some research on restaurants. I have not been to SPB in 15 years and needed restaurant ideas. My Russian parents and American husband loved Pelmenya. We ate there 4-5 times and tried pretty much everything on the menu. Xinkali were my favorite. Manti and pelmeni were very good as well. Food was fresh, service quick and professional, beer nice and cold and prices were just right. I would definitely go there again and recommend it to my friends!"
Positive,1,"Very goodWe ate very good.

On can choose between lots of different kinds of ""pelmenis"" and other dishes mades of the same pasta. There are 3 sizes for each dish (S, M, L) according the amount of food. They have the menu in English inside. There are vegetarian options. The price is very reasonable."
Positive,1,"Very good mono choiceRelaxing, cozy. A waitress reserved a table for us without even asking our name. The service is perfect. The menu is in Russian and in English (it's a plus in Russia). Almost only dumplings, but of every kind. Good beers and teas.
By the way, I forgot my iphone on the table and, when I got back half an hour later, a waitress gave it to me with a smile."
Positive,1,Low prices high satisfactionIt is a lovely little authentic Russian dumpling restaurant. Food is good. Prices are low. The only problem is that it is hard to let waitresses understand which menu item you want to order. There is English menu but the waitresses cannot read the alphabet. But if you want to try vareity of delicious dumplings you shoul visit this place.
Positive,1,"Great food, good service and low pricesWorth the visit. We'll come back and try some more. If you go there, try the fried khinkali. It¨s really delicious!"
Positive,1,"Fast, friendly and deliciousWe had two stops at Pelmenya on a rent trip to St. Petersburg.  Menu is simple - but very well executed.  My wife ordered a Chinese dumpling, which was not as good as the Central Asian ones.  Manti - Khinkali - Sauerkrauts is the way to go."
Positive,1,"Good monocuisine conceptI've been here several times with my foreign friends when I wanted to make them try something traditional without the pathos of many overpriced Russian cuisine restaurants in the city. And we never left unsatisfied.
Place has a trendy design and nice atmosphere. The food concept is good and balanced, perhaps I would add/change drinks and desserts, the choice is a bit too limited. The food quality is very good. The service is sometimes a bit slow."
Positive,1,"Great dumplingsVery tasty food, nice and cozy design, and homelike atmosphere. Favourite place for lunch. Staff is very friendly and easy-going. Strongly recommended :)"
Positive,1,Brilliant!Delicious dumplings and a huge variety to choose from. Just next to faberge museum so went for lunch after we had done a tour of that. Reasonably priced. Lovely restaurant.
Positive,1,"Dough and Meat - is everything )))different kind of dumplings, with various filling, the most amaizing is Georgian Hinkali, Russian Vareniki with cherry!
Atmosphere good, location is perfect near the 5 corners in the city centre!
the prices r very nice!
must visit!"
Positive,1,"Unexpected delightVery lovely place. The food is good. Kind of the same dish from different countries: Russia, Georgia, Ukraine, Italian, Central Asia, China and Japan. Service is also very good and friendly. Worth to visit."
Positive,1,"Very good restaurantVery nice place to eat. First night we went it was full we had to go back the next night. There are many varieties of dumplings on the menu and we tried many of them, there range from good to excellent. Prices are very reasonable too other than the Chinese and Japanese dumpling varieties. The wait staff spoke good English and were helpful. Definitely worth checking out."
Positive,1,Very nice foodwe really like going here... it is an ideal place for any occasion. The food and service is great !!
Positive,1,"Space for improvementIdea is great: dumplings from all over the world: Russia, Georgia, Central Asia, Japan etc.
We visited Pelmenia yesterday, because since last three years my family and me are big fans of Georgian dumplings called Khinkali.
Khinkali here are 4 stars (from 5) maximum, even 3.5.
From my point of view meat is too fat and dough/pastry is too thick.
Third point Khinkali price per piece is too much high as well. Average price in Moscow is 35-45 rub. Here it is 60 rub if you order 3 pcs.
Service is nice and friendly."
Positive,1,"TRADITIONAL FOOD WITH EXCELLENT RELATION QUALITY PRICEIt is really difficult to find (in a single place) the Traditional cuisine, the quality, the confortable atmosfere, the reasonable price, in a good central location (Fontanka) and the good service.
This is the exception. I have been once and I was transported to the old Russian times testing the original flavours and the traditional Pelmeni & Manti but in the menu there are other mixed cuisines like Italian Ravioli and some Japanese filled pasta that I cannot remember the name."
Positive,1,"Deliciously filling!Delicious and chill vibe! Try the Khinkalis (Georgian soup buns, really filling). The Pelminis and Varenykys are reliably delicious. The dim sum not so much."
Positive,1,"Dumpling HeavenJust a stone's throw from the Fabergé Museum, this place looks like a bar but serves dumplings in many shapes and sizes. Pelmeni are Russian dumplings but we also sampled dumplings from Uzbekistan, Georgia, Ukraine and Japan. if you're not sure, have a small plate of 3 and then order more if you like them. There is a menu in English and the waitress was very helpful and explained what each different type was. Service is great and the prices are very reasonable. It's also very handy if you are planning on taking a boat trip to see the bridges."
Positive,1,"Eat here with your kids after seeing the Faberge MuseumFun inexpensive place with great range of dumpling choice from ravioli to Russian dumplings and Korean style. If you are uncertain you only need order 3 to 5 dumplings and reorder those you like best so great if you are with your family or in a small group. Dumplings are served quickly and are all very tasty so it is quick, fun and convenient to try them all out. Good choice for vegetarians or fussy eaters or those more sophisticated who can have prawn and water chestnut dumplings! Menu in English available and staff willing, friendly and quite good at English too. We visited in April and no reservation necessary. Ideal if you want to independently visit the Faberge Museum which you can only do after 6pm and then have a nice family friendly dinner before returning to your hotel"
Positive,1,Pelmeni barLittle restaurant specialized in pelmenis. Great place to have something small to eat or to taste many courses and enjoy them a bit longer. We went there on Friday evening about 20.00 pm without reservation and there was plenty of free tables.
Positive,1,"Dumplings from all over the worldGreat place to have some ""pelmeni""! Delicious dumplings from all over the world - Russian pelmeni, Georgian hinkali, Asian manti, sweet Russian vareniki, Italian ravioli, Chinese jiaozi and dimsams."
Positive,1,"Ate dumplings until I couldn't moveSo delicious! Got the dumplings with pumpkin and lamb, cheesecurd and sour cherries, and beef. All were great, cheap, and filling. Relaxed atmosphere, convenient location."
Positive,1,"Went twice!I almost never eat somewhere twice, but I went back to Pelmeniya two times in four days in St. Petersburg. I love stuffed pasta/noodles and they have examples from all countries, but I especially love Pelmeniya the Russian version, but the Italian pasta was also good. The price was also extremely reasonable."
Positive,1,"Best pelmeni I hadPelmeniya specializes in the mono cuisine concept, serving only pelmeni and dumplings of the same sort. And it was, by far, the best pelmeni and the best khinkali I had during my one month stay in Russia and Ukraine.
The ambience is very pleasant and the service is quite good. And they also have a very good belgian beer menu, although at a bit ""spicy"" prices."
Positive,1,"Different and uniqueI am not fan of russian food at all but once in paris i tried the varenyky with cherry filled...since then i was not able to find anything good or similar, this place exceed my expectations, i tried the ravioli with cheese and spinash, the varenyky with mashed potatoes and the varenyky with cherry...i will strongly recommend the one with cherries, there others were good too but u find cheese and potatoes everywhere in the world so it is not that special, the place is charming, hidden but for sure a coming back place...I put 4 stars bc u have to wait a bit to get ur food, it is worth it"
Positive,1,"Good Food Good Customer ServiceThey have menus in English.  Very tasty pelmeni.  They made a mistake on my order, and served me something incorrect.  That happens everywhere sometimes, but the unusual part is the waitress came out and admitted the mistake.  In Russia that is not very common.  My Russian is very poor so that sort of situation can be tricky but they were really nice about it and offered to remake it.  Because it takes 20 minutes and I was already pretty full I declined, and they removed the item from our bill even though we ate some of it."
Positive,1,"Mono cuisine really worth to try!We tried the one located on the corner of Razjezhaya street and Pravdy street (near metro Vladimirskaya). Wonderful Caucasian dumplings - ""hinkali"" - are superb! Juicy and mild-spicy. Remember to eat them correctly - using hands - first you bite a small bite of the ""shell"" and drink insides, then eat the rest - ask waitresses they explain :) Also we tried ""manty"" - dumplings made on steam; with lamb - tasty! fabulous! They were accompanied by sour cream and fresh vegetables. Excellent Belgium beer as a drink choice - honest Belgium quality!"
Positive,1,"Damn good dumplings that won't break the bankJust off Nevsky Prospekt is this little place along the Fontanka River. It does a variety of inexpensive dumplings from many of the countries where they are a staple & all of those we had were excellent. There is a decent selection of beers, and even an ale which was a real treat. As previously mentioned, the dips and sauces could be improved, but the dumplings are good enough without them. English menu & fast, friendly service. A great cheap eat."
Positive,1,"A Dumpling Journey Around the WorldIf you like dumplings the best way to try them all is to go to one of the ""Pelmeniya"" restaurants. These people have dumplings from Russia, Japan, China, Georgia, Poland and Mongolia. Pretty much every nation obsessed with dumplings is represented. The've also got dumplng soups and sweet dumplings with cherry or curd, so everyone will find something they fancy.

The interior is spartan, yet there is something charming about the chair backs shaped as rolling pins and the gloomy ""robotic waiter"" statue greeting you at the entrance. Totally unforgettable.

The service was nice and we even got two extra fills of tea water in our tea pot!"
Positive,1,"Dumplings from all over the world!In this restaurant you can order dumplings from all over the world: pelmeni and varenyki (from Russia and Ucraina), manti and khinkali (from Caucasos), dim-sun and gyoza (from Asia) and ravioli. I tasted almost everything (except ravioli!) and all was tasty! The place is nice, good service and even cheap prices."
Positive,1,"Excellent place, service, price.Reviews of this restaurant is true. Meal is very taste. You can see dumpling picture on their picture and choose they based on picture description if you don't know how they look like. 
They have free WiFi. 
When we received receipt we get two Orbit chewing gum as well, very nice surprise!"
Positive,1,"An excellent place to eat and enjoy the retro atmosphereWe spent an enjoyable evening at this restaurant. The food was excellent, just don't expect a sweet as he doesn't have any. It doesn't have a license but the moc tails were very good. The owner is very friendly and loves his restaurant and the 80's music is fantastic!!"
Positive,1,"Delicious lunch with great music!Today on Friday April 12th we had a late lunch at the very cosy Loft restaurant in the old Medina of Essaouira.
We tried the vegetable soup with Parmesan cheese, the vegan salad, the Seafood penne and the grilled octopus. All dishes were very tasty, Zoubair did great service and the 60’s and 70’s music (including Elvis) was amazing.
All together we paid 425 dirhams for a delicious late lunch."
Positive,1,"Excellent eaterie.Excellent eaterie, well priced, great location, very reasonably priced. Lovely little spot. Welcoming staff, and very nice food."

Positive,1,Great little restaurant in the medinaWhat a delightful surprise to find this little restaurant in the Medina. The avocado crab salad and the dukkah chicken were delicious and beautifully presented. Service was friendly and professional.  An added bonus was the clean bathroom with toilet paper and napkins to dry your hands.
Positive,1,"It deserves a Lofty reviewWonderful experience in the old town of Essaouira, fantastic Moroccan food both of the land and sea. Beautifully presented that made your mouth water without the delicious smells from the kitchen.
We eat so quickly we forgot to take photo’s of the food."
Positive,1,Relaxed dinnerTerrific chilled vibes with atmosphere and great service. Food was cooked to perfection especially the fried octopus and pasta with shrimp. Very flavoursome food which was inexpensive.
Positive,1,"Simply stunning!Stunningly a
Wonderful food. We visited around 5 years ago, and headed back for our first night back is Essaouira, we weren’t disappointed.

Hope to be back again one day soon! Highly recommend 10/10"
Positive,1,"PerfectWe came here for lunch, loved it and came back another couple times.

Positive,1,HIDDEN GEM!!!ABSOLUTELY PHENOMINAL CUISINE!!! It has a Moroccan fusion menu. Our group was so impressed that we returned with a much larger group the next day. The service was superb. The ladies in the back were cooking with love. The Loft is a MUST TRY restaurant when in Essaouira!!!
Positive,1,"So good, we visited twiceWe chose this restaurant based on past Trip Adviser reviews. As a seasoned traveller, and a food lover, here’s our assessment. 

We arrived around 7pm as a family of 4 seeking authentic Moroccan food.  

Food: Excellent tagines and fish dishes. Offered starters; mains and deserts.

Drinks: No alcohol, but lovely fresh fruit juices.

Service: Excellent – friendly and efficient

Ambience: Quirky with walls covered with 1960s/70s and 80s radios and TVs. Played 80s/90s music. Relaxing and never rushed.

Payment: Excellent value – mains, deserts and drinks totalled 725 MAD. Visa/MasterCard accepted.

So good, we made a second visit another night.

Highly recommend."

Positive,1,A DEFINITE PLACE TO VISITGreat little place. food was immaculate and impressive. almost like michelin star looking food but for a great price!!! I got the octopus salad which was great there wasn’t one mouthful that wasn’t full of octopus. I also had the marinated chicken which was the cheapest option but did not let me down. It had deep rich flavours of nuts and other lovely spices. The restaurant design was quirky and nice with good music. A DEFINITE PLACE TO VISIT!!!!

Positive,1,"Lovely Dinner at LoftLoft was recommended to us by some fellow travellers we met in Marrakech the night before we arrived in Essaouira. It's a lovely wee cosy restaurant , with a relaxed atmosphere. Both our mains were great ( fish and a beef dish) and our desserts too - Panna cotta. The staff were really friendly and helpful. Would recommend this restaurant for a nice, relaxing dinner in Essaouira. We were glad to have had it recommended to us!"

Positive,1,"Great food!We absolutely liked this little restaurant. Not too many tables, a smallish menu but the dishes of exceptional quality and taste. The decor was great and service unbeatable. 

They also accommodated our kids, who unfortunately are not the most adventurous eaters. Thank you so much for this."
Positive,1,"A feast for all the senses, this place is very cool and very good.Ok so these guys are very clever, the whole concept has been very well thought through…60 70s Antique decor, brilliant 60s playlist… really cool ambiance… then there’s the food. Smart menu board… keep it to 5 or 6 starters and mains but do them well…..they do! 
We had the avocado & crab starter, then grilled octopus for me and shrimp for my wife, it was all delicious. 
Can’t fault it, this is fine dining at a very affordable price."

Positive,1,"SeafoodBeautifully quaint little restaurant with the most amazing food and friendly service - we loved everything about this little gem of a restaurant.
We ordered fresh shrimp with pasta and zucchini and fresh grilled octopus.  Both dishes were absolutely delicious and super fresh.  Big plus is the pricing cannot be beat - very reasonably priced.  Served with olives and warm bread and spreads.  Sooooo goooood.
Highly recommended."
Positive,1,"Fine dining at affordable pricesWe found this restaurant whilst meandering through the Medina. We decided to give it a try. Our friends were not keen at first due to the limited menu and the lack of alcoholic beverages.
We nearly left but boy I am glad we gave it a chance. The food was fantastic. It was visually pleasing and tantalizing on the taste buds.
We left the restaurant fully satisfied with all aspects of our visit and we will return again."
Positive,1,"Tiny, but not hiddenThe place is kinda small, but then again, so are all restaurants in this area. They actually make good use of their space. It’s all decorated with some vintage/retro appliances. Service was fast, even though there was a bachelorette party going on, which definitely counts extra points."
Positive,1,"Dinner at The LoftGreat corner location, Splendid and cosy design, friendly and professional staff and most importantly, the food is AMAZING , grilled octopus dish is phenomenal. I will definitely come back, a highly recommended place."

Positive,1,"Tasty seafood and cool vibe of restaurantWe stoped by for lunch and we are so happy that we did - great, tasty food, friendly service and cool interior. We had starter - crab & avocado tartare and for mains grilled octopus which was great and prepared the way it should be - very tender and seafood pasta. After eating tajines most of the time, this was a great refreshment! By the way - they have great music selection!"
Positive,1,"Excellent food beautifully presentedOur hostess at Chems Bleu Riad recommended The Loft & we weren’t disappointed. We sat upstairs in the tiny Loft, looking down on other diners & the unusual decor of old radios, TV’s etc. The appetiser was the first difference - not the usual olives & harissa but tiny tasters of beetroot & basil dip, plus olive dips, with homemade bread. We both had the crab & avocado salad which was beautifully presented with more beetroot dip & other sauce. Maggie had the beef tagine, an enormous amount of shredded beef which was rather dry without gravy/ sauce but nonetheless tasty. I had the king prawns with saffron sauce, accompanied by a timbale of rice & veg, & avocado & chopped tomato. Then as we sat back, replete, the host brought a complimentary pot of verbena tea & a caraway biscuit each. All delicious & good value for money. Highly recommended."

Positive,1,"Perfect Lunch SpotJust had the hottest, very delicious vegetable soup here. Chilly day so it hit the spot.  Followed it up with one of the best salads I’ve ever had - and a lot of it.  The salad was vegan with shredded red Cabbage, lettuce, apples, nuts, quinoa, a touch of grapefruit and pear and just a hint of citrus dressing.  Fun spot with assorted ‘50s modern decor. Every table different. Cozy"
Positive,1,"Greag food, ambience and service.Really great food, ambience, welcome and drinks. 
After on the house apero, we shared a crab and avo starter, then went on to a pulpo grillé, served with fresh veggies and a fried spiced chicken dish served on mash. 

The orange, carrot & ginger juice and fresh fruit juice also deserve a mention as being delicious and very refreshing. 

We’d go back for more."

Positive,1,"So good we went there twice during our 3-day stayWhat pleases me most is that they dont pretend to pander to the customers. There is no fixed menu so its what they buy fresh at the markets and they close at fixed hours.

And they have unbelievable food.

We tried the chicken, John Dory fillet and the prawns.

Absolutely amazing."
Positive,1,"Nice MealWe stopped into the Loft for lunch on our second day in Essaouira, and it's safe to say we were not disappointed! The atmosphere was nice and relaxed, the staff were friendly, and the food was excellent. The highlight for me was the Crab/Avocado Tartare. One thing to be aware of as a western tourist here is that they do not serve alcohol in this restaurant."
Positive,1,"Delicious foodRecommended by a resident of Essaouira. Small, very cozy and the food is fantastic. Service is very friendly and good. If you want cozy and delicious food, go to The Loft."

Positive,1,"5 Star FoodValue for money here is outrageous!  This would be 5 star food  in any European country; simply fantastic food, hardworking staff who do  a superb job and a lovely soundtrack also. We were impressed beyond expectations"
Negative,0,"OkFood was pretty good but everything took ages, one staff member on the floor serving every table. With more staff members would come back"
Positive,1,"Delicious fresh local food served with style in simply stunning sixties decorWhat a find. This beautiful boutique bistro decorated in genuine vintage 60s style is just inside one of the side gates into the town of Essaouira on the corner of rue el hajjali. 
Spotlessly clean and welcoming.
Serves a limited menu of ‘freshly caught daily’ fish.
All freshly cooked to order and beautifully presented. Flavours sublime.
We had beetroot dip with both black and green olive tapenade appetisers. As ever bread you could eat and eat and eat it’s so fresh and scrummy.
Then avocado and crab - so fresh, clean and delicious in texture and taste. Lovely little touches on the plate of a carrot curl marinated in cloves and a sprig of rosemary mimicking the carrot top. Thick unctuous balsamic vinegar. More beetroot dip. One of the best starters I’ve had in ages in any restaurant anywhere… oh and it cost 65 Dirham (£6).
My partner then had the shrimp and calamari pasta in red sauce. I had John Dory with fries and veg. Again freshly prepared and trully scrumptious. 
We are going back again tonight."

Really cool decor and we were super surprised at how reasonably priced it was. Would definitely return and highly recommend. Well done to the people from The Loft."
Positive,1,An Unexpected DelightIt was very unexpected to find a tiny restaurant in the medina that did grilled pulpo so perfectly. I love this dish and this cute place really delivered a delicious meal that the many restaurants I get it at in Lima Peru would be matched.

Positive,1,"the best dinner in essaouiraso happy we decided to visit this restaurant duo to its original decoration , turned out to be the highlight of our visit to essaouira, everything was just great. the food,the atmosphere and the people, it was hard to leave thats how good everything was , i will surely be back again"
Negative,0,"IntoxicationIt was a bad experience for us. After eating there we got a bad intoxication. We couldn't sleep at night and the next day was horrible. We couldn't go out, we just stayed in the hotel. This restaurant ruined our vacations in Essaouira and I will never eat there again."
Positive,1,"Hidden TreasureA hidden treasure among the back streets of Essaouira! 
Small but full of life we found this restaurant very welcoming and the food was wonderful! Would highly recommend a visit if you are looking for somewhere to eat."
Positive,1,"Lunch at Loft EssaouiraGreat for lunch and dinner , an Amazing place, chaleureuse and very clean , the staff is so professional, spent 2 hours there couldn’t leave the place because of its beauty and food quality. Highly recommended"
Positive,1,"I’m becoming a regular!The place is all around great! Great food, great people, great atmosphere… I already came back after my first visit and I will do it again."
Positive,1,"Amazing lunchLunch was fantastic. It was hard to choose, everything on the menu sounded amazing. We visited in March when they closed in the afternoon, so glad we decided to visit at lunch time! Calamari a la plancha was phenomenal."
Positive,1,What a jewel...we found ourselvesWhat a jewel...we found ourselves a little treasure for lunch in Essaouira. Avocado & crab starter was beautifully plated & so delicious. Every dish was as appetizing!
Positive,1,"Amazing!! Best meal I had in Morocco!So happy we decided to visit this restaurant. The atmosphere, staff, and music were great.. But the food was incredible! We split the avocado tartar with crab inside to start. The avocado was deliciously creamy, and its flavor was complemented excellently by fresh tomatoes and red onion. The crab meat inside was beautiful. We learned from the staff that the chef at The Loft is the original creator of this dish, which we had seen on several restaurants in Essaouira. While the rest of the menu changes all the time, this staple stays by popular demand. We understood why! Afterwards we split a seafood tagliatelle in spicy tomato sauce and a salmon dish. Both were excellent! Could not recommend this place more! It was a huge highlight of the trip!"
Positive,1,"Good food in EssaouiraVery tasty meal, a fresh change from daily unvarying Moroccan meals on group tour.  Most tourists. Busy so call ahead or come early."
Positive,1,Funky restaurant with tasty foodJust ate lunch here. Great friendly service. My squid tagliatelle was delicious and the house burger also tasty. Funky designed restaurant.
Positive,1,"Delicious!We love this place and try to go there at our yearly visit. Delicious and original menu, all fresh and made to order."
Positive,1,"Dining ExperienceFirst the The Loft, has a unique antique look and has a great ambiance to dine. We ordered our food and appetizers and the server ask us if we wanted the appetizer first, which was nice as we were not asked this question in other restaurants. The avocado crab cakes if my memory serves me correctly was delicious and the presentation of the plate was exquisite. Our cuttle fish presentation by the chef ""Zakaria"" was awesome and we were enamored by the whole appearance,. This completely our taste nothing to do with others choice we were not a big fan of the cuttle fish as we were expecting a fish filet and instead of the squid family of fish. I need to be honest I will definitely go again and would give them 5 starts for the service and presentation and ambiance"
Positive,1,Lunch visitThis quirky restaurant served good food at good prices with friendly staff. Would have gone back if we had had more time
Positive,1,"A bit of european taste in MaroccoGreat octopus, nice tatar, delicate tea :)  pretty inside 😍 good quality and good prices (big serving)"
Positive,1,Wonderful dinner at a great spotWe had a lovely evening with great food and very good and friendly service and.... good music from a dj
Positive,1,"The Loft Restaurant was a great find in the Médina.This was a great find in the market. It was so good at lunch we went back for dinner. Small & intimate with American music from jazz( Dave Brubek) to smooth rock. At lunch we  had  a variety of starters. We shared an order of spring rolls, a stack of avocado, with fresh tomatoes,onion and topped with fresh crab meat, and last a smoked grilled sardine plate. They were presented beautifully and tasteful.
We returned for dinner and shared the avocado stack. My wife ordered the grilled salmon accompanied with fresh eggplant and a purée of turnips. I took the waiters recommendation and had the tagliatelle with shrimp& calamari. Both dishes were excellent along with being served hot.
There is no alcohol served and best of all inexpensive by American standards ."
Positive,1,"What a different little placeJust walking by we liked the look and it didn't disappoint us.  A small place with interesting and colourful decor.  We were shown up to the 'loft' part which is small but fun.  The food was brilliant and cheap.  We had octopus and calamari cooked to perfection.  Not a rubbery bit in site.  There is no alcohol here which isn't a bad thing to cut back on once holiday.  BUT you must try the carrot and ginger drink.  Freshly squeezed/blended etc.  So refreshing, tasty and almost a meal in itself.  The staff were charming.  It also looked as though it is a great place for single people to eat.  We saw a few there happily alone and smiling.  Try it."
Positive,1,excellent foodWe visited this restaurant twice in a short stay with another couple and all had different dishes.  All four of us were very happy with our order.  The service was attentive and friendly.  The decor was excellent with lots of retro pieces on walls
Negative,0,"Not what we expected- badWent to the loft because it was recommended in Lonely Planet. I was hugely dissappointed. Since we are next to the port, I wanted to eat some fresh fish, but nothing available. We had calamari with rice and salmon with celery and aubergines. Food had no spice, no salt and no taste. The place is too dark and toilet is right at the entrance of the restaurant in a wooden barrack. Not sure why this place was featured in Lonely Planet. Not recommended."
Positive,1,"Best Dinner in EssouiraA cool modern place with a modern Moroccan vibe. Low lights and romanticish music. Everything is fresh and delicious. Had the salmon and the pan fried calamari. Also, the avocado tartar with crab. Would definitely come back next time in Essouira."
Positive,1,Amazing foodQuite simply one of the best meals I've had for a long long time - had the octopus dish and the calamari dish and both were super. Highly recommend.
Positive,1,"Excellent ExperienceWe were there for New Years Eve. Received great service, great menu, excellent food and a wonderful atmosphere"
Positive,1,LunchBeautiful little restaurant great atmosphere. If you time your visit well it has a great eating area upstairs
Positive,1,"DeliciousIt was soo god i could eat every day there, but i was a little bit sad, there was no vegetarian option! But the salmon and the slow cooked beef were very very delicious!
The restaurant is very cozy and the people are very friendly and nice!"
Positive,1,"Nice and tasty!Bravissimi! The staff has been very friendly and the food was very tasty. Interior of the local is very well design and thought. Very fair prices. We had 2 starters (avocado&crab tartar + vegetables soup, the olive oil on the soup was superb) and 2 mains (octopus and squid) + some tomate pasta for our little baby: 420 mad!

They don't take reservations, the good old rule 'first comes first served' applies!"
Positive,1,"went twice. Great PlaceWithout the internet we asked someone in a shop where to eat. They said this place because they knew the chef.
Really small menu , really nice food. Went twice would go again. Very friendly people too"
Positive,1,"Something different.Relatively small menu that manages to offer , Spanish, Moroccan, International inspired dishes.  Some great choices. I like it because it offers something different ! Decor is eclectic, quirky , different  ! Good, relaxed ambience. Efficient service. Reasonably priced for quality of dining experience. Premises are not very big and they do get very busy. It is alcohol free if that is important to you - either way."
Positive,1,"Gorgeous RestaurantWe were looking for somewhere to eat so we looked around to see who was busy.
The Loft was very busy but managed to fit us in and near the kitchen.
We watched and looked around at this very small restaurant that was so vibrant.
The food was excellent and the service very friendly and efficient.
We would definitely return again"
Positive,1,"The best food!The Loft was such a great restaurant. The atmosphere, the decor, the food. We visited in November 2019 and didn't book. We only had to wait about 20 minutes and we managed to get a table for 2. The food was absolutely amazing. We loved it there. When we visit Essaouira again we will most definitely return."
Positive,1,Best meal in Essaouira!We ate here twice in a week and the food was delicious both times. The goats cheese roll starter is amazing and the Moroccan chicken was beautifully spiced and tender. (We also tried the salmon and the crab and avocado.) It always seems very popular so if you’re planning on going then get there early to get a table!
Positive,1,A little gemWe were very lucky. Arrived for lunch just in time and they prepared us fantastic meals. Grilled Octopus and grilled spicy salmon both well presented. Very generous portions. They don’t serve alcohol so tried their ginger orange carrot juice which was refreshing and tasty. Nice music in the background made it all a delightful experience.
Positive,1,Great placeFriendly staff and yummy food along with unique DECOR.I came each day of my 4 day visit to essaouira and had the lentil soup with Argan oil. Addicted! 😁
Positive,1,Not to be MISSED!This very hip restaurant loft on 4 levels with a very cool interior was the highlight of my 3 days in Essaouira. I went there 3 times! The monkfish with saffron sauce was delicious and the live music was really fun.
Positive,1,Most delicious salmon in years.....My friends loved soup and we shared the salmon which was perfectly cooked and perfectly lightly seasoned. A masterpiece. Small restaurant. Music was quality western music. Service delightful!
Positive,1,"Lovely visit for dinnerWe had a very nice dinner at Le Loft in Marrakech. The waiter, Chakib, was very friendly and prompt. The shrimp and avocado salad was the only thing I didn’t love. It has a thousand island type dressing on top and I was definitely thinking it would be more fresh rather than heavy. The ambiance, however, was a nice contrast to the hustle and bustle of the city life. And the lounge cover songs were hilariously fun. Greatest hits from the Police, Peter Gabriel, Bob Marley, and many more. 10/10 would recommend."
Positive,1,"Great fusion foodGreat restaurant - had been recommended to us - food was excellent, and took local cuisine up a notch with the chef's unique flair.    No alcohol licence, so if you want wine, plan that for later"
Positive,1,"Best monkfish!We found The Loft while wondering through the streets of Essaouira. It was a small, cool place, with a kind of vintage feel to it. The soundtrack was so right up my (and my husband's) street, to the embarrassment of our 9 years old because of our gentle moves and singing along! The menu was small and the food was lovely. My tartare of tomatoes, avocado and crab was a first for me and absolutely heavenly (will definitely be doing at home). My husband's sword fish was cooked to perfection and my 9 years son didn't leave any of his calamari behind. Service was friendly and quick. They are a young team of Moroccans, who seemed happy with what they, which was lovely to see. They were warm and generous with their tips of other places to go and eat. Highly recommend!"
Positive,1,"Great experienceWe’ve had several good dining experiences in Morocco, but our dinner at The Loft was among the best. We arrived just after sunset, around 7:30, which was timely as we got right in just before the crowd. Our server - who was working  maybe eight tables at the same time - spoke good English (as opposed to my poor attempts at French), was friendly and extremely competent. The atmosphere was modern with a traditional feel, the food and drinks (sorry, no alcohol) came quickly and what we ate - grilled octopus for me, monkfish for my wife - was excellent. Definitely worth checking out, especially the saffron creme brûlé for dessert."
Positive,1,"Great dinner in MoroccoWe found The Loft wandering around the alleys and streets of Essaouira and the blackboard menu looked great.
We were a group of 11 and they happily made room for us all even tho' on two tables. The menu was not the usual touristy fare - my husband had breaded chicken and loved it, someone else had the octopus. The staff were very friendly and welcoming, decor great and the music fab.
can thoroughly recommend this eatery in the wonderful town of Essaouria"
Positive,1,"Yum!Not a huge menu, but everything on there is just perfect!!! You can taste the attention to detail and all the love that goes into this chef’s food. And the eclectic vintage decor is a fresh take on modern Moroccan design and innovation. Not to be missed if you’re visiting Essaouira."
Positive,1,"Best squid I've ever had!My friend and I went yesterday to the Loft and it was an amazing experience.
The staff was really friendly, the place was clean and music was nice.
The best part obviously was the food. This was probably the best and biggest squid I've ever had.
Highly recommend the place especially if you are pescatarian like me and you are struggling with food in Morocco!"
Positive,1,"The best octopus of my lifeThis restaurant inside Essaouira's Medina is an example of how you can turn on local and fresh food into something innovative and delicious.
We went twice and we ate so well.
Of course the prices are different compared to the traditional restaurants..but every Dirham it's worth it (and you can pay with credit card ;) )
My favourites were the eggplant millefeuille and the grilled octopus day-dish.
Absolutely recommended"
Positive,1,"Lovely surprise!Best meal we had in essaouira. Friendly staff, food was delicious en very cosy/nice decorated! We would definitely come back."
Positive,1,"Great lunch spotVisited Essaouria for a couple of days, and my friend and I had lunch twice at The Loft. This place is so cool. Retro furnishings, old school rock and jazz and the food was delicious. I’m still dreaming about the goats cheese and raisin spring rolls. Easy to find spot, and the staff were so friendly. Don’t miss this place when you visit the city!"
Positive,1,"Fabulous dinner, ambiance, food and musicWe had a great dinner 
All the diners were raving about the food
Everything we had was special
You need to eat here"
Positive,1,"A cosy cornerA warm and cosy restaurant with delicious meals and a retro decoration.
""Calamar à la plancha"" was excellent and the juice was just fresh.
The Waiter was very welcoming, caring and smiling.
Very nice experience.
Big up"
Positive,1,"Reviews are correct:  outstanding foodA few notches above the rest in Essaouira.  Nice atmosphere, good service, nice presentation, and a delicious meal. There are places that have  “5 star” reviews because they’re compared to inexpensive/street food.  This is just straight-up a 5 star rating. Period.  The cost, honestly, was not as much as expected.   It compares well with all the other low/mid-range priced restaurants.  Not sure what pushed this to the $$-$$$ range...
...and save room for the saffron creek brûlée"
Positive,1,"SuperbThis was unquestionably the best meal we had during our two weeks in Morocco, and maybe one of the best meals anywhere in 2019. Understand that this is not a folksy Berber themed place, nor does it aspire to white tablecloth formality. Instead this small place is comfortable, eclectic and welcoming (That goes for the staff and the interesting but not overpowering playlist in the background as well). Our dishes were well-prepared , with ample servings and quality ingredients--I'm thinking of the lamb with pears and the warm salads."
Positive,1,"Wonderful food in a retro settingA friend recommended Loft to us so we thought we’d give it a try. It’s always a good sign when the menu only offers 4-5 choices for each course, but you still find it hard to choose! The food was fantastic. It was fresh, beautifully cooked and well presented. It’s a small restaurant but has a great relaxed feel. It has lots of retro items on the walls which is great to look at whilst waiting for your food. They have a great taste in music too. There is usually just one waiter, but he has his eye on the ball and serve you with perfect timing. The food was so good we visited 3 times during our stay. Thanks so much for our wonderful food Loft."
Positive,1,Delicious foodThe best food so far on a one week stay in morocco. The spicy chicken was lovely. The champ was an added surprise. Great music lovely fresh lemon juice and good vibes. Would we come back... yes please!
Positive,1,"Lovely little restaurantWe really liked the atmosphere of this place. Very tightly packed place, but still feeling private at our table. Food was very good as was the service. Mix of traditional as well as some twists."
Positive,1,"Funky place with phenomenal foodWe were hesitant to go into a restaurant with a purely English name but couldn’t ignore the reviews. We made a point to walk by and decided to try it out given the quaint atmosphere and menu. We sat upstairs and enjoyed a great meal. The ginger and carrot soup, cooked salads, beef medallions, and lamb tangine provided delicious introductions to Moroccan food: the fusion of flavors was different but very pleasing. Enjoying mint tea once we were done was a nice touch. Great value for the service, food and atmosphere! Highly recommend for dinner."
Positive,1,"Top !Very nice restaurent in Essaouira. The service, deco, atmosphere, dishes, it was relaxing and very good !"
Positive,1,"Fantastic Dinner!We had an amazing dinner, modern moroccan  cuisine, fantastically spiced and made with lots of love! Shukran!"
Positive,1,Delicious and freshGreat small restaurant. All dishes were of high quality and well prepared at very reasonable prices. The carrot soup a d fresh grilled octopus are highly recommended.
Positive,1,"Yummy spot!Excellent ambience, entrees are amazing. The monkfish should not be missed. Tea at the end was a highlight! Very chill place to eat in Essouira."
Positive,1,"Delicious dinerJust had a delicious diner with our family. One of the most tasteful and refined we had in Morocco. We had several meat (lamb, tenderloin) fish (prawn) dishes and vegetarian (goat cheese spring rolls) dishes and safran crème brûlée and yoghurt deserts which were al very tasteful. Staff was friendly and the atmosphere was relaxed."
Positive,1,"DeliciousWe have tried a few restaurants in essaouira, but we came back again and again to the loft during our stay.. It has the most delicious food (i think we tried almost every thing on the menu - starters, main course and desert -and everything was fabulous! The staf was funny and friendly, the music was great, and they have a nice mixed style of traditional dekoration and stuff from the 60tis...very likely we will return!"
Positive,1,Essaouira foodI really enjoyed my food in the loft was delicious. Also the decorations was really amazing. good service i recommended
Positive,1,Pure brillianceHaving been eating out for lunch and dinner every day for a week. This is the best place I’ve been to so far. The food was fantastic!! The atmosphere was great!! The waiters were very friendly!!
Positive,1,Excellent lunchGreat service and the food was delicious and the juice I had was amazing. Can't wait to come back again. I highly recommend it.
Positive,1,We rarely enjoy our food therThanks for great welcoming the service it rarely good we wish to come back again thanks for nice food
Positive,1,"Very delicious food!Delicious food, a lot of choice on the menu. Central location very nice! The staf are very friendly! Recommended place to visit!"
Positive,1,"Delicious foodNice, cozy, small restaurant with good service and delicious food! Go for the fish of the day (if available)! And enjoy the music. :)"
Positive,1,Excellent FoodI was sorry to see that the restaurant Elizir no longer existed but was delighted to find The Loft with its quirky interior and delicious food. Presentation is on point here. Wish them the best with this venture.
Positive,1,"Friendly place for a mealJohn Dory, good. Squid, good. Cooked vegetarian salad, good. The avocado salad was delicious. Service was very welcoming and friendly. The portion sizes however we found to be very large to the point we tried and tried but none of us could finish."
Positive,1,SuperrrrrVery beautiful. The food excellent. I found for vegetarian too.The service great. The location is very beautiful decorate and clean . I am coming with pleasure every time when I am in Essaoira
Positive,1,"Amazing food, great service, lovely restaurantJust had dinner in this absolute gem. Only had one course - the special of the day - but it was flawless and such good value for money that I thought they’d undercharged us.
The design is fun mid-century modern, and the service and staff are both efficient and friendly.
Does not serve wine but does serve delicious juices an non-alc cocktails - in generous glasses.
Hope to go back before we leave Essaouira- and be more hungry!"
Positive,1,"Cozy Space With Amazing FoodA shopkeeper recommended this place and I’m so glad I went. After traveling in Morocco for almost two weeks I was looking for food that was a little different from the standard but still had a Moroccan flare. Special of the day (which I had): saffron prawns, risotto with octopus, avocado with cherries on top, and ricotta and spinach rolls. For desert I had saffron creme brûlée 😊 Attached is a photo but it doesn’t do it justice. As soon as I walked in I knew I would love it though because they were playing Leon Bridges (which had been on repeat for me during this trip), BB King, Etta James, etc. Check out the Sony sound system they use 👍🏻 Make sure to find this place and enjoy!"
Positive,1,recommendedwe ate here twice as it was good value and quite interesting cuisine - no booze but the fruit smoothies were excellent
Positive,1,Fun and fabWhat a welcome break from touristy places nestled away from the crowded cafe area. Small 23 or so seats. Great music. Waiter is terrific. Ladies in the kitchen churn out delicious creations. Fresh modern comfortable.  Everything was great.
Positive,1,Best dinner in Essaouira for vegetarians tooFabulous music and vibe. We had a lovely beef and pear dish and they were able to put together a vegetarian main course made up of the appetizers.
Positive,1,"Funky, friendly, tasty, coolWe had lunch on our last day in Essaouira; what a great choice. The avocado, shrimp and crab salad was superb!!"
Positive,1,"Fresh and friendly placeDuring another visit in Essaouira I could not miss my favourite place for lunch. Delicious fresh food, well presented and laid back but professional service."
Positive,1,"Awesome food!Nice, cozy place with really delicous food. 3 out of 3 would come again. Prices are fair for the food"
Positive,1,"Lamb tagineWe visited at 8pm and got one of the few remaining tables (the restaurant does not take reservations). 
I chose the lamb tagine, which was sumptuous and plentiful.
The orange, carrot and ginger smoothie was also very tasty.
The restaurant is quite cozy (tables are close together) and staff are very friendly.
The bill was quite reasonable."
Positive,1,"Cute,  quaint and romantic.As soon as you walk in you feel like your home.
It's like walking into your living room and you feel so very welcomed.
The service was great and they had an English menu to make it easy to order.
I had the fish couscous which was a large serve and full of veggies which I was happy about, my partner had the meatball tagine which i couldn't help to invite myself to share.
A must try and was very romantic, so perfect for couples but not for kids. It's small inside, so you feel you are on sitting close to other tables but that adds to the atmosphere!
Great prices, very cheap!"
Positive,1,"Delicious food and great service!!The Loft served us some amazing food when we visited for dinner!!

Starters and mains were delicious and very reasonably priced. The retro theme of the restaurant was a great change and the service was impeccable. 

Card payments accepted, only soft drinks available. Would highly recommend visiting and especially trying the specials they have."
Positive,1,"Funky fine dining.This place is funky, fresh and family friendly. And the menu is unconventional. There are many unusual and delicious dishes and it was difficult to choose just one. I had the lamb tagine with pear and my wife had the John dorey fish and we goat cheese rolls for starters. All the dishes were delicious. The ambiance is chilled and the music is funky. They even have baby chair and made our baby feel very welcome. The staff are friendly and professional. All in all one of the best dining experiences we have had in Morocco."
Positive,1,Quick lunch on day trip to EssaouiraExcellent food & service. Chose a monkfish and lamb tagine and saffron creme brulees. Not disappointed. Quirky decoration. Good music. Glad we found this little gem.
Positive,1,"An Affordable Foodie FavoriteMy husband and I had lunch at The Loft our last day in Essaouira and it was one of the best meals we had eaten over 3 days at a fraction of the other prices. I started with the carrot soup--of which I am generally a fan--but this was both unusual and delicious! (The spices mixed well with the sweetness of the orange and carrots) I then had the monkfish with rosemary and I was delighted not only with the taste of the dish, but the artfully arranged plate. (Must post a photo to show you). Yes, it is an affordable, small casual restaurant, with friendly staff but you will not be short changed on the quality of the food!"
Positive,1,"Wonderful quirky placeI loved it because there was so much on the p!ate, small amounts of different salads that I wasn't  expecting. All were perfect."
Positive,1,"Great music and delicious food!My boyfriend and I had a lovely meal here - the food was delicious and flavourful and the atmosphere is cute and quirky. The music they played was also really great. All around excellent, would highly recommend!"
Positive,1,Great restaurantCouldn’t fault the special of the day! Was absolutely delicious. Great atmosphere and lovely food! Will recommend to friends!
Positive,1,Mind blowing Fish dishWe had a fantastic John Dory fish with avocado and goat cheese rolls. The taste was amazing and good value for money compared to some of the tourist scams. People were queuing 45 min to get a table. Non alcoholic with very fair prices.
Positive,1,"Small but packs a punchWe went to this restaurant as two couples at the end of a long day sight seeing and shopping in the medina. It is a fascinating place. The Loft had been recommended by our tour guide.  

It is a small place in the medina at the intersection of two streets. It has an upstairs as well as the main level. We had a comfortable corner table and ordered our starters and wine right away. Then we ordered dinner entrees and everything we had was wonderful and authentic. When we looked over at the kitchen area, we saw that the chefs were all ladies - possibly the moms and sisters of the owners. The food was excellent."
Positive,1,"Coolest restaurantCoolest restaurant in town with great taste of music! Great food, service and location... definitely recommend x"
Positive,1,"Informal, fabulous foodSpotted The Loft on TripAdvisor so decided to give it a go.  Relaxed atmosphere with very tasty food. Menu a bit different to other local restaurants. Very friendly service.
Children aged 12 and 15 really enjoyed,"
Positive,1,"Great food and atmosphereWe visited the Loft while we were on a day trip to Essaouira. The menu caught our eye as it was a nice alternative to what most of the other restaurants offered. I liked the decor and retro music that they had playing. The staff were friendly and attentive. We each got a main course, the chicken and noodles, and the john dory and risotto special of the day. The food was so fresh and tasty. It was the best meal we had on our holiday. The prices are very reasonable too. 

Definitely not to be missed if you're in Essaouira!"
Positive,1,"Best food we had in MoroccoHappened on this restaurant just off the main square in Essaouira, and was sucked in by their menu, seemed to have a bit of everything (seafood,Moroccan, European). Went for the John Dory special, my girlfriend had the chicken noodles. Both were done so well, bordering on fine dining. Atmosphere was cool and relaxed, we definitely put it top of the list of places to visit for food in Morocco."
Positive,1,"Great place, excellent for valueWe have visited Essaouira for a day trip. This restaurant offered a refreshing setting and menu, and the staff was friendly and professional.

The food was great for value. Would definitely eat here again."
Positive,1,"Refreshing dinner and excellent valueCame her as a family of four (two 12 year old boys) having been here a couple of years ago. The food was as good as we remembered it - really tasty, well presented food. Had slivers of steak with pear, chicken noodles, crispy chicken with yoghurt and spicy sauce and lamb couscous. It was slightly Moroccan but totally different from the usual tagine stuff found in lots of places. This was a stand out meal for us in Morocco and the boys who are sometimes a little fussy couldn’t get enough of it. Amazing value at £42 for all of us (incl starters and non alcoholic drinks). Boys had smoothies which they wanted to call out as being “amazing”."
Positive,1,"Good food and comfortable placeI went there with two friends for lunch. 
The stylist decoration with good music. It is relaxing atmosphere. 
Food - unexpectedly tastes, I think it’s fusion Moroccan and European dishes. 
Staffs - nice with polite smile. 
I will come back this restaurant again when go to Essaouira next time"
Positive,1,"Good food, atmosphericWe had a great meal here on the Mezzanine part of the restaurant. The food was legit and very well presented. Music and furnishings gave the place a great atmosphere."
Positive,1,"Wow wow Awesome FoodThe loft really exceeded our expectations! The restaurant is small; the decor is nice and the service was great! Now the food, instead of serving olives like all the other restaurants in Morocco they served us olive spread it was really really good! We had the crab and avocado tartare and the eggplant and goat cheese plate for appetizer. Both were fantastic. Main dish we had the beef and caramelized pear. Wow!"
Positive,1,"Advised to us by our tour guideCool “hipster” style cafe/restaurant. Perfect place to eat if you want fresh fish as good prices in a clean environment. Not very vegetarian friendly. They were able to make a side dish of vegetarian food but didn’t know how to price it.
Food is served in a photogenic way. Very delicious after backpacking the Atlas Mountains and countryside for 9 days.
Orange juice didn’t taste too fresh. Took a long while to serve."
Positive,1,"Very good food, excellently presentedSmall place in the Kasbah with a 1950s -60s vibe inside (vintage radios, cameras, tvs), interestingly mismatched vintage furniture. Limited menu, very good food, excellent presentation. We had crispy chicken with hot sauce and yoghurt, and gambas in saffron sauce, risotto and vegetables. Creme brulee with saffron to follow. Friendly, efficient service. Reasonable prices (150Dh for gambas, 90 for chicken)"
Positive,1,"Great Food and Service! In stylish nice place!Had a great evening with very delicious food, great music and very friendly service! Highly recommended!"
Positive,1,"Great food in a modern environmentAs per title great food in a modern environment, gets busy around 7.30-8pm so go other times or be prepared to wait a short while"
Positive,1,"Became our regular place to eatThe Loft became our favourite place to eat as we found no where else as good in terms of quality and value.dips and bread were just so good.    The wonderful complimentary dips and bread were just so good; every time.  Some of our favourites: starters: aubergine and goats cheese Mille-feuille - divine, as was the prawn and safron suace with allthe lovely additions again divine.  The food is really so good all the while listening to fab 60/70's and 80's classic music.  The two men running worked so hard to please and were very friendly.  Every night we had the complimentary dips, starters each and mains bottle of water - all for under £40 usually between 30 and 35 - wow."
Positive,1,Great cool and cozy placeGood (fusion) food with a Moroccan twist. I loved it!! The service is great and the design retro. Intimate place where I ate almost every day during my stay.
Positive,1,"Must try please!Yum Yum~  Great food with great decor.  Love the twist and modern touch of Moroccan food!  It was recommended to us by our tour guide and we are very satisfied with the choice.  Both the presentation and the taste of every dish was impressive.  ""Crackling chicken""-delicious and a nice alternative to the standard couscous, tagine and skewer dishes we have been consuming all week during our Morocco trip."
Positive,1,"The best place in Essaouira!We wondered where to go in Essaouira and this place was recommended to us by many. Iťs been the best choice! Great food, perfect and friendly stuff and very available location. Higly recommend to everyone!"
Positive,1,"Fab FoodWe Visited the loft as an off chance. No disappointment here. Great atmosphere with popular background music. Jazz/ blues etc. 
Modern funky decor. Great service. 
The food is just ‘excellent ‘. 
I had the Monk fish dish, this was cooked to mouthwatering perfection!!
Accompanied by beetroot, avocado and an absolutely delicious rice. Delicious. They also gave me some gorgeous mash cause I asked for it, not knowing what was awaiting me. 
My friend had the Lamb Tagine, served with gorgeous pear and saffron rice with almonds and walnuts. Really delightful flavours and textures which she described as the best meal she has ever had In Morroco. 
Complimentary mint tea served. 
Can’t wait to return."
Positive,1,"Corner delightThis place was opened using creativity and love. “Mega loft” soon opened down the road stealing the menu and the decor. The owner did his best to change decor and rotate the menu. They deserve more and work hard and it’s clear. 

Great food!"
Positive,1,"Great vibe!We went here for dinner due to its great reviews and it did not disappoint! The vibe is so relaxed with awesome music and cool decor. The food was amazing; we had the goat cheese “crunchy rolls”, the soup which was awesome, then I had the crackling chicken which were amazing and finally my partner had the swordfish which was the catch of the day. 

They do not serve alcohol which was the only downside but did not take away from the experience at all."
Positive,1,"FabWe all enjoyed eating here. The restaurant has a quirky vibe and the food that we had was delicious.  Even though we all are different meals, we all agreed the restaurant was one of our favourites and we would go back in a heartbeat."
Positive,1,Great mealLovely little restaurant - food was excellent. Very reasonable. No alcohol served but didn't take away from the experience.
Positive,1,"Marvelous new year’s eve @ the loftSmall place somewhere in narrow street not far from the main square! A hidden gem!! No reservations ... so be patient! We had wonderfull evening with delicious food (for a fair price, in a nice atmosphere). For example monkfish cooked in cream sauce, grilled shrimp with saffron risotto and much more. I think, one of the best restaurants in Essaouira 👏👏"
Positive,1,"Vegetarian friendlyWe had very tasty lunch, lovely fresh juice. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. Note: they have a siesta break  between 3 and 6 pm."
Positive,1,"Seriously delicious, funky lighting, great music, friendly staff.We had a delicious lunch at this restaurant in the middle of the Medina. Seafood menu, funky lighting, great music, friendly staff. 

Loved the crab-avocado tatare and John Dory as fish of the day. Super tasty chocolate mousse!"
Positive,1,"Great food in a nice atmosphereThough we like to eat in more local places, we could not resist the nice atmosphere of the loft while passing by. The music they play is just what you need after hearing moroccon music for a few days. The food is moroccon styled, but different than the typical tajine. The penne with salmon was very good!
Slight disadvantage: the food is served a bit too quickly."
Positive,1,Loved my dinner hereI have a delicious and affordable 3-course dinner here.  Started with eggplant napoleon (kind of a mille feuille with layered eggplant and goat cheese).  The lamb tagine with prunes and pears was lovely and the creme brulee was unusual as the creme was denser than usual.  It's a very relaxed and good choice (good for single diners) in a slightly off-the-beaten path location.  Recommended by Lonely Planet.
Positive,1,"Understated brilliance!Fancied a quick lunch whilst on a day trip to Essouira- stumbled across the loft and it did not disappoint! Chilled out, cool atmosphere, food and service fantastic - we had found that service can be somewhat lacking in Morocco compared to European standards. Wished we could have spent longer in the city so we could return. Thanks guys, great experience all around."
Positive,1,"Fantastic little stunnerReally enjoyed our meal here. We went for a day trip out to Essouira. Having eaten out twice a day for 4 days and found a common theme of the service being a bit lacking this was a pleasant surprise. Attentive service, great decor, and a delightful meal. Highly recommend the monkfish!
Will return and stay long In the city next visit"
Positive,1,"Food Surpise- DeliciosoWent for Dinner,  absolutely fantastic tasty vegetarian and other dishes! Service sweet and fast,  everything super delicious and prices fair.  Thanks to the whole crew.  Special Goat Cheese and sliced  Beef with mash and a the composition of different ingredients! Super cool,  11 out of 10 Points!"
Positive,1,"Traditional Moroccan fine diningFood was stunning, restaurant upbeat, modern serving traditional foods with a modern twist. 
Would have loved to gone again. The service was great and the crispy goats cheese rolls with walnuts and raisins were to die for! Good service, great food and highly recommended! Fabulous seasonal menu!"
Positive,1,"Tasty food, friendly service, good atmosphereTasty food, friendly service, good atmosphere! We stayed in Essaouira three nights and visited this place twice. Warmly recommended!"
Positive,1,"Nothing to wish forCute little restaurant in the Medina, amazing food and good atmosphere. Unfortunately this is no secret as you will find loads of people queuing there in the evening. 
Service is very friendly. Thank you for a splendid evening."
Positive,1,So glad we gave it a tryIt’s making my mouth water thinking about what to write. Delicious food. Reasonably priced.  I would have liked to have tried all the menu. Unfortunately they close on Sundays. Best chocolate mousse I have ever had.
Positive,1,DinnerJust finished a very enjoyable meal at the Loft. It was excellent and the best meal I have had in Morocco. I had the beef tenderloin with pears. Also recommend the goat cheese egg rolls.  Interesting and fun atmosphere. I highly recommend.
Positive,1,An excellent restaurantMy family and I went for dinner here when in Essaouira and were not disappointed.  The food was superb and the atmosphere in the restaurant was excellent.  The choice of music was particularly good.
Positive,1,Just perfectThis is a great restaurant. The food was excellent- the crispy goat’s cheese rolls were delicious as was the beef and the chicken. The staff were friendly and the ambience was modern and different. Small and beautiful- no wonder they could have filled it more than twice.
Positive,1,"Amazing food !This is a great little restaurant.....

Quirky decorations !

Exceptional service !

Great Food !

I had the sliced beef with mashed potato and my wife had the chicken & vegetable noodles.

The Creme Brûlée was amazing !

No alcohol served :(

We will come back to try the deep fried chicken as that looked yummy 😋"
Positive,1,"Lovely spot, good music & excellent foodHighly recommended - the food a blend of maroccan tradition and western favorites, fresh and tastes good."
Positive,1,Excellent foodWe chanced upon this restaurant and got the last table around 7.15 pm. My husband had the Warm Moroccan Salad &  eggplant with goats cheese both entrees. I had the lamb tajine with pear & walnut. A line up waiting to get in as we left so popular.
Positive,1,Lovely food and atmosphereMy husband and I visited The Loft. Such an amazing place; nice decorated and the food was really delicious.
Positive,1,Nice placeSmall place with good food. We Like atmosthere with music. Small menu choice but everything looks and taste very good.
Positive,1,"LunchLovely lunch at the Loft, very good fish and seafood. The service was excellent, interesting interior"
Positive,1,"Great food, fascinating setting.I had walked past it and was interested and saw the reviews and was tempted. I visited and was very happy. Friendly staff, complimentary bread and tapenade. My dinner (lamb couscous) was delicious and a good size portion, not too much or too little after the bread. No alcohol served, but the mint tea was excellent and made with fresh mint. And the surroundings of old school lighting, hifi, cameras and decor is a real treat."
Positive,1,Absolutely lovelySuper dope interior. Fantastic (big portion)  food. Excellent service. Fresh juices and even a live band.
Positive,1,"Really good mealHad a really good meal here although the menu was a little more European and less Moroccan than other places. There were several healthy options, juices as well as food. The presentation was artistic and pleasing. Eclectic music which was a bit loud but fun. The decor was unusual with nic nacks everywhere."
Positive,1,We loft it !We had the monkfish and the chicken and we loved both dishes! Super friendly staff and great music matching the interior. It’s in the heart of the city center and therefore easy to reach.
Positive,1,"Stunning FoodAbsolutely delicious! A nice change from traditional Moroccan food and fresh as can be. Defiantly recommend, great food, friendly staff and quick service! Took parents for their 21st Wedding anniversary and they were extremely happy."
Positive,1,"Very cool decor and music, excellent foodSometimes when a restaurant decor and music are very consciously ""cool"", you find that there can be a loss of focus on the food. I'm happy to say that it's NOT the case here. Actually we ate in some superb restaurants in Essa, but my Loft crab on avocado base, followed by lotte with saffron sauce was up there with the very best. My family said similar things. The service was friendly, and the price was very reasonable. There is no alcohol license. It is very small, so I imagine guests should consider that they need to turn-over tables quite fast to make a reasonable business. So don't be selfish, let other people enjoy it too! :)"
Positive,1,"Great decoration, friendly staffWe went to The Loft just for a drink after dinner, and we were so happy to find such a nice place, decoration is amazing, good music and friendly staff.
Unfortunately it was too cold to enjoy the terrace, but it was a great place for our last night in Essaouira."
Positive,1,"perfect!This is really a perfect restaurant fresh seafood and an excellent service!.
The plates are served as a present and everything on it is tasteful."
Positive,1,"Amazing foodWe went to this place as a treat night as its a little more expensive than some of the other restaurants near by but it still turned out a very reasonable price. Its a cute place, not very big which gives it a cosy vibe. However the food was delicious! Beautifully cooked and original dishes you don't normally find in morocco, my boyfriend and I were still raving about the meal for days after. 100% worth the visit. Also the waiter was really friendly and fast."
Positive,1,"Wonderful FoodLovely small restaurant serving very tasty food, the chicken noodles were delicious and so was the fish that my husband had, very friendly owner, definitely worth a visit."
Positive,1,"Loveliest place in Habana ViejaNice place to visit, a lot of people, very animated location, music, fun and restaurants in the area. The walking tour will naturally lead yo to this spot, so do not miss it!"
Positive,1,"Beautifully restored buildings, great restaurants, good music, dancingThankfully, our Airbnb apartment was only two blocks away from this charming square.We were able to enjoy it lively atmosphere, street dancing, live music, shops, and delicious restaurants. It is not too touristy as it is also enjoys by locals and tourists. We ate at the restaurants on the Square and nearby four times ."
Positive,1,Perfect !This large square is really pleasant Day and night Good place for architecture loversThere is someMuseums Some good bar and restaurant One big church Feel so good
Positive,1,"Our favourite place in cityVery beautiful square, always full of people. A lot of bars and restaurants near by. A couple of places have free WI FI so check it."
Positive,1,"Surrounded With Old World CharmThere is a beautiful fountain, and old cathedral, several large sculptures and SO MANY AMAZING RESTAURANTS! I highly recommend La Vitrola!!!!!! The food, live music and waitstaff (Shout Out to RAUL) are wonderful!!!"
Positive,1,"Historical heart of HavanaThis 16th Century plaza is the original, historic heart of Havana and a must see place. Keep your wits about you though as there are hustlers everywhere with it being the tourist centre."
Positive,1,"Nice SquareNice place, many choices for lunch or dinner. Try to avoid the scammers and stay alerted for them..."
Positive,1,"Contrast of Architecture & run down neighbourhoodLoved this part of Havana (apart from hotel Inglaterra - gave us raw chicken in a BLT, terrible service, stay away).  Not only is there fabulous architecture with Capitol buildings & theatre, but the mix with local run down dwellings is quite a contrast, you will be able to access the hop on/hop off buses here as well as classic car tours (approximately 40 £/E/$ per hour, probably 2 or 3 hours is enough)."
Positive,1,"Nice plazaBeautiful square, you will find people dressed in traditional clothing for pictures, sometimes performers, and sometimes people playing music. Cool architecture."
Positive,1,"Nice walkGood place to walk around the Plaza area and surrounding areas, but don’t expect to be able to purchase anything.  No public toilets and many restaurants were not open. It is safe to walk, but not many signs, so you need to download or print a map."
Positive,1,Plaza Vieja - a must visitAn ideal spot to stop and look at the various architecture around the square. It has a central fountain as well as a strange cockerel statue. On the day we were there it was extremely hot and so we took the opportunity to go upstairs at the Don Eduardo Alegre ( which is near the cockerel) and sit at the balcony with a small beer. You do appreciate the square from a different perspective and can think back to when executions and bullfights took place there watched by the wealthy from said balconies.
Positive,1,Great square in the centre of old townThis square is always bustling with people. It has a great vibe and  while the restaurants all try to get you to come into their place you are pretty much left alone.
Positive,1,Best plaza in HavanaThis is the most picturesque Plaza in Havana having originally been founded in 1559 and renovated in 1996. It is a essential stop on a walking tour of old Havana. Would suggest having a drink in one of the cafes.
Positive,1,"Good starting point in HavanaOk let me be clear: the area is very nice and easily accessible. It is the right place to start your (preferably walking) tour in Havana.OTOH, you cannot miss how poor people are, the ruined buildings in which the live, the numerous beggars.It’s a mixed feeling and tourists should be objective on how things are now Vs how they would like them to be or were several years ago."
Positive,1,"Beautiful Old Square.Definitely worth a visit, the best of the squares in Havana.  Lovely to walk around and take in the Cuban life. Some beautiful buildings, some of which are cafes and restaurants and one a micro pub.  We were on a tour with a guide during the day and visited here but decided to come back to see it in the evening.  It has a lovely fountain and a bit of a weird statue and while we were there there were ladies in Caribbean attire looking very colourful, old ladies smoking big, fat Cuban cigars and men walking on stilts.  This makes it sound showy and lively but it was a very relaxed and quiet atmosphere. The restaurants upstairs have balconies on which to sit while eating and watch the world go by.  Quite a romantic setting in the evening for dining out and yes most restaurants are aimed at tourists but still felt very Cuban."
Positive,1,Heart of Old HavanaOld Square - The Plaza Vieja is a square located in Old Havana. It was designed in 1559 and is the most striking plaza in Havana from an architectural point of view. Here the Cuban baroque coexists with the Art Nouveau inspired by the Gaudinian style.
Positive,1,"old, has characterEnjoyed walking around the Old Square, and taking in all the history and character of the buildings. Several small food options and even a few street vendors selling coconuts, then once done the coconut water bring it back and he'd cut up the coconut to eat."
Positive,1,LovelyFabulous experience seeing how th Cubans live. Glad we had a guide to explain everything. I wouldn't have learnt so much on my own.
Positive,1,"Isabelle (France)We visited the 16th-century Plaza Vieja, which is surrounded by well renovated elegant colourful colonial residences. In the middle of the place, we saw the beautiful Carrara showpiece fountain.We were lucky because during our visit, there was a fine exhibition of very fine painted cats in Plaza Vieja!!!"
Positive,1,BeautifulThis is a beautiful old square in a lovely old part of Havana we visited while on a tour of Havana there are lots of lovely squares to go visit
Positive,1,Nice arcitectureThe Cubans really put an effort to restore the beautiful old buildings. You can feel the atmosphere of old times!
Positive,1,"Surrounded by History.The history in Havana's buildings is legendary. At 500 years of age, there's something magnificent to see at every corner. The plaza here was a delight. Good lines of site to the various buildings, so we grabbed a seat at a table in one of the cantinas and ordered ourselves a drink. Just a great place to visit, pass some time, and people watch."
Positive,1,"Simply MagicalI didn't go to any of the cafes or restaurants so cannot comment on the quality of the beer or food in this area...however...as a stand alone square I think it has unrivalled beauty.  It absolutely took my breath away.I've travelled to many, many cities all over the world and done my fair share of town squares & plazas, but this one, has gone straight to No1 in my list.  Mesmerising."
Positive,1,"Restoration continuesHaving visited Plaza Vieja during the Special Period when it looked like London at the height of the blitz (WWII), it is always a pleasure to see the continuing restoration and rejuvenation of this stunning square. Excellent."
Positive,1,GreatBig open space in a crowded city. Feels more like a colonial area than much of the city. Plenty of bars
Positive,1,One of my favorite places in the world!I have been blessed to go to over 75 countries in the world and this square is one of my favorite places in the world. I don't know what it is.. there is no single thing that makes it stand out but a combination of factors that beautifully blend . From the cobbled streets that lead to it.. to the restaurants and Cafe's that adorn it's edges ... Enticing you to stay . The architecture is beautiful and I spent a lot of time writing.. sitting at the second floor of one of the many Cafe's .Highly recommend it.. but don't got to just take selfies and pictures... Spend some time and you will fall in love with this place just at I did.
Positive,1,Perfect place to kick backI'm not sure if it was a time of day factor or if this was normal but there was hardly anyone in the square.  Unlike other areas teaming with people Plaza Vieja was surprisingly quiet.  Stunningly beautiful and a perfect spot for a mohito!
Positive,1,"Take a Cruise into Havana Harbor and you step out onto the SquareWe’ve cruised a lot, and this is hands down the best point of disembarking of any place we’ve sailed into, except for places one can only tender to. The area is interesting, though you’d be hard pressed to find any souvenirs to buy with your Cuban tourist funny money. Many shops all selling the same government approved kitchen. The dancers on stilts were worth watching. Pretty sure cruises from US no longer go to Cuba."
Positive,1,Historic areaIt is good to see that this historic part of Havana has and is being fully restored thanks largely to UNESCO. Dating from 1559 it was once called 'New Square'. It was originally used by the military and then later was a market.
Positive,1,"Habana PlazasPlaza Vieja is a great people watching square with the requisite fountain and several restaurants, many with upper galleries. It’s a great spot to take in the architecture and see and feel what life would have been like promenading around the plaza."
Positive,1,Beautiful Square but expensive.This is the main sqaure in Old Havana and a wonderful place to see and perhaps take in the Havana atmosphere. It has a micro brewery in one corner and a very popular restaurant with constant music. However be careful as it also attracts tourist prices and the micro brewery with light or dark beer just make up a figure for your bill which is always over. Take my advice and get down the side streets for better quality and half the prices.
Positive,1,"Restoration to its former glory a good startWell on its way to being restored to its former splendour.  The square is large and each view is stunning.  Once completely restored, it will be spectacular"
Positive,1,Lovely squareStop in for a coffee or a bite and a drink and enjoy the beautiful scenery. The people watching is amazing as you watch locals and tourists interact.
Positive,1,InterestingThe architecture here is interesting and from here you can see the other side of the harbour.  There are cafes where you enjoy a cocktail and in the centre there is a very pretty garden.
Positive,1,"The time capsule of HavanaThis area is almost like a Disneyland recreation of what Havana would have looked like in the 1900-1950s. Everything is beautifully restored.This is not necessarily the real Cuba of today, but it is really beautiful.  There are some amazing structures here."
Positive,1,"Renovations CompletedAfter years of restoration, this square Is finally free of fences and scaffolds. Great place for pictures of architectural buildings. There’s a micro brewery where you can sit down and people watch."
Positive,1,Great area and best restaurant!Cafe bohemian is the place to eat here. Best food ! Italian as owners are from Rome! Area is lively during day and evening.
Positive,1,"Beautiful Square!The buildings in this square have been renovated, so you get an idea of what Havana looked like in its hey day. The architecture is just wonderful. A gathering spot for the locals."
Positive,1,"Intriguing, colourful, livelyThis plaza was built in 1587. It has been renovated entirely using the UNESCO funding.  In the middle of plaza there is a new classical marble fountain. La Casona is a palace from the 1800th century - nowadays an arts center."
Positive,1,Interesting historyThe guide was really knowledgeable about the history of the square and the buildings around the square. Allow plenty of time to soak up the atmosphere
Positive,1,Lovely little plazaOne of many to be found in Havana in the old town. We wandered around the area which can alasobe reached by taxi
Positive,1,Havana TourToured the entire area (it was swamp land) restoration of the old area has progressed over the years. It is beautiful and definitely worth the time to peruse.
Positive,1,Lively CourtyardAt day or night this place is a great place to pull up a chair and sink a Cuba Libre to relax. Plenty of bars and resturaunt.
Positive,1,Crowded and atmosphericOnes you walk thru old Habana you will pass this square.There is always something to do and to see.
Positive,1,"Moving woman and cockerel sculpturePlaza Vieja, is probably my favourite square in Havana, primarily because of the evocative and moving structure of the woman forced into prostitution to feed her family, sitting astride a cockerel. The lily sculpture is also very good and there are several decent cafes for lunch or just a mojito and people watching"
Positive,1,Old SquareI really loved this square. A lovely atmosphere and lots of people being guided by their tour operators. I stayed in the nearby Raquel Hotel for a night as I was returning from a 12 day trip to Cuba. I recommend this area as it is full of character.
Positive,1,"Best plaza!The charming Plaza Vieja has got many restaurants, bars and a micro brewery. From some of the bars, you can overlook the plaza from the balcony."
Positive,1,Beautiful squareOne of the nicest squares in old Havana. Plenty of architecture to appreciate. Go early to avoid the crowds.
Positive,1,"Worth going to in the eveningWe had a walk to the Square one evening, live music playing and a lovely atmosphere it’s right by Mojito Mojito’s"
Positive,1,Great place to visitReally great place to visit with a lot of museums and restaurants around it. Definitely one of the nicest parts of Cuba.
Positive,1,Beautiful placeToo many street hustlers in Cuban national costumes. Lots of interesting sightseeing around. Couple modern excellent sculptures are on the square.
Positive,1,"Beautiful!Our last dinner in Cuba was spent at a restaurant on a balcony at Plaza Vieja. We loved watching families playing. Great live music, awesome vibe!"
Positive,1,"Worth another Trip All on its OwnWe went to this part of Havana (as well as others) as part of a city tour. Truly, I had expected the area to be much shabbier than what it was. True, you saw buildings with facades only and no roof, but you can tell there is a concerted effort to restore many of these beautiful buildings to their former glory. It would have been wonderful to visit the many museums in old Havana - but that will have to wait for our next trip!"
Positive,1,Lots to do in this squareThere are a bunch of restaurants. A card museum unfortunately it was closed when we were there. Also i am pretty sure this is where they had public executions in the old days. And a statue of a lady ridding a chicken. What more could you ask for.
Positive,1,"Great personalized tour by G&G ToursWhat a wonderful way to visit Havana, by cruise ship. Oh, I guess that's not available to US citizens any more. The Old town of Havana is rich in history and the people are welcoming. A small but growing semi-capitalist economy based upon tourism beckons and it is still a chance  to support the people who have gone out of their way to learn English."
Positive,1,"Great spotThis is a lovely square. Beer factory is in one corner, good drinks. A couple of bar/restaurants on the 1st floors, great for lunch or a drinks break and free wifi, a bit slow but no need for scratch card here."
Positive,1,Great place to chillIt's a beautiful place to chill and have a drink but the prices at the bars and restaurants are pretty high.
Positive,1,"Charming Old SquareWhere night life abound, bars, restaurants, music and more music. Situated in Old Havana we used this place as our focal point of our 5 days in Havana."
Positive,1,"Music, music, outdoor cafes, balconies.....and historyLoved this plaza...they had just fixed the fountain, and, of course, the famous gal on a rooster statue is here.  Latin music in all corners, some dancing, sometimes a stage with entertainment, always lively and SAFE at night.  Loved it!"
Positive,1,NightNice place best in the evening when the crowd is out and live music is playing at several restaurants with seats in the square.
Positive,1,"Hidden gemPerfectly restored, only ten minutes walk from the Cathedral. Try the best cuban coffe in a bar just in a corner of the square."
Positive,1,"Lots going on in Plaza ViejaPlaza Vieja is a must to chill out in. There are multiple bars and restaurants/cafes and at any time in the evening there can be up to 3 bands all playing lively Cuban music. The Plaza has been renovated as it had fallen into disrepair but now it is a hive of activity and so welcoming. We really felt comfortable there and would recommend it to anyone wanting to just sit, drink a Pina Colada or Cuba Libre and just enjoy the vibe."
Positive,1,"Lots going onThe squares of Havana are very busy. You will see a lot of people walking, singing and dressed up in traditional garb."
Positive,1,"A great place to startThe Plaza Vieja in Old Havana is a great place to start your walking trek around the old, colonial part of the city. You can easily get to the capital buildings and the other lovely parks situated throughout the area. And there are wonderful restaurants! Everyone at each of the restaurants was warm and welcoming and the food was great at all we went to."
Positive,1,"Charming, Newly renovatedThe place looks newly renovated sourounded by Several cafeterias and bars. The hart of Havana and Nice to walk Around in the street  s leading to the square. Have a drink or a coffee at one of the cafeterias and Enjoy life"
Positive,1,"This place rocks !!Beautiful buildings.... 2 or 3 bands competing with each other, dancing in the open....even the street sweeper got into it.On the corner is the most amazing restaurant with all sorts of goodies hanging from the roof....all from the 50's.Also a bar  brewery here with a car in the bar."
Positive,1,"go when the antique vendors are thereSome really delightful finds at the little antique vendor booths around this square. I bought some antique stamps that are so charming. And I bought some small art prints there too. I also saw small religious relics. lots of books.Havana is amazing. tragically beautiful. friendly, welcoming."
Positive,1,"Beautiful square with great vubeWe stayed in a casa particular on plaza Vieja during our recent trip to Havana. This beautiful old square is filled with life, music, dancing, beautiful buildings, great restaurants and interesting art. The true centre of Old Havana. A must visit experience when in Havana"
Positive,1,"Cool To Walk ThroughA beautiful open square filled with adults, kids, and everyone in between. Good for pictures but I opt for more out of the way spots for my selfie'ing."
Positive,1,The lively squareDay and night you pass by this square and it's always  lively. Music and drinking and singing everywhere by local and visitors alike. Lots of restaurants are close by and it's a perfect area to just hang out with friends and enjoy the evening.
Positive,1,"A must go Plaza!This Plaza has many restaurants and hotels were you may stay but most especially, enjoy good food, coffee and live music!! I recommend to visit La Vitrola!"
Positive,1,Personal walking tourPlaza Vieja is one of the sites that the Cuban government has completed in restoration and it is gorgeous. it is far too extensive to give in detail but when visiting Old Havana ( Habana Vieja) this is a MUST on what to see. This is a step back in time!! The architectural qualities here are Baroque & Spanish influence.
Positive,1,A beautifully renovated PlazaPlaza Vieja is a lovely place to sit over a meal or drink and people watch. There are plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from.  The buildings are beautifully restored.
Positive,1,"An astonishingly beautiful place to admirePlaza vieja has been beautifully refurbished all over! I saw from a picture how it had looked before and the difference is breathless. All the buildings look new and clean. The place is clean, has nice sculptures and a big nice fountain. From some bars beautiful live music is heard. The restaurants, bars,  museums, even the spa makes you willing to pay a visit. In one of the corners of the square, there is a building with a lift. If you go up, you can see beautiful views of the city and make nice pictures. There is a dark room with a guide, who by a device shows you all worth seeing and explains the history showing the various places and monuments. I spent 3 hours admiring the square from above and below. No one must miss to visit this square."
Positive,1,"Beautiful stained glass windowsI've visited the Plaza Vieja many times, but every time I am amazed at the beautiful stained glass windows that grace the square.  As a stained glass artist, I love to see other's work, and see how such beautiful glass has withstood the test of time.  I've see the square at different times of the year, week and day, and this time I got to see the elementary children in their school.  It isn't just a tourist attraction, it is a working square with 2 schools.  One of my favourite places in Old Havana."
Negative,0,"Old placeThe old place, have many fashion and tupical bar and restaurant.  Salsa  music in all bar and restaurant. Thery nice place."
Positive,1,Beautiful!This is a beautiful square with nice colored houses and palaces.  The buildings are restored now.  Look at the balconies and the details.
Positive,1,"Our favorite plaza in Havana ViejaRoomy, great buildings and giving exactly the Havana vibe you are expecting. Restaurants and bars are more commercial and touristic but that's the price you pay."
Positive,1,"Plaza ViejaOne of the old squares in Havana, a must visit for every traveler, especially to see the architecture that is traditional to Cuba."
Positive,1,"Plaza Vieja, The Old SquareThe last of the forth squares in HavanaThe Old Commercial square, surrounded by mansions and apartments blocks from where residents could look down processions, executions, bull flights, etcAt present time surrounded by good bars and restaurants; La Vitrola Restaurant, a good choice or Café Mercurio for those who like coffe and smoking a cigar"
Positive,1,"Captivating and central space of Old HavanaThe old square is a small space where many of the attractions of old Havana are concentrated. The beer house on one side, on the other side, the fabulous restaurant - bar La Victrola.For the little ones after the coffee, the Planetarium of Havana and in the other corner the Dark Chamber, a building on whose roof, a replica of one of the inventions of the famous Da Vinci makes the light be projected on a concave plate where they are reflected Live images of the surroundings of the city.It is a lovely place where art, history and science combine. Wonderful, without a doubt."
Positive,1,One of the centrals squares of HavanaA must see in Havana is Plaza Vieja. If you visit the old Havana you see all the Squares and definitely this square.
Positive,1,"Pretty but very busyGood opportunity for lovely photos here. Fascinating old buildings and home of Obscyra, although it was closed for renovation when we went ! Bars are expensive and always seemed to be busy. Worth a visit though."
Positive,1,Great placeThis is a great taste of Cuba. Spontaneous music and lovely places to eat. Old buildings look great and is active well into the night.
Positive,1,Very well restoredThis is a beautiful square that has been restored. There are several restaurants and places to have a beer or a cocktail. We went to a restaurant that was on the first floor and had an excellent view of the square. Worth a look whilst walking around ‘Havana Vieja’.
Positive,1,"the old plaza that looks newNever tire of this place! I love feeding the pigeons, watching the school children play, enjoying the sculptures and ambiance and architecture.  Several places in and around to get a bite or a drink."
Positive,1,"Popular square with innumerable namesIn 1559 it was an open space and was called Plaza Nueva (New Square). It played a significant role in the town as all the wealthy people had their mansions around it and watched  executions, processions, bullfights and celebrations from their balconies. That's why very important buildings from 17th,18th, 19th and even 20th century still embrace the square. In the 18th c it was called Plaza del Mercado (Market Square). Then through the centuries it was called Plaza Real, Mayor, Mercado, Fernando VII, Plaza de la Constitution, Park Juan Bruno Zaya and Park Julian Grimau.In 1980 Old Havana became a UNESCO World Heritage site and a big restoration project began at the Square. A replica fountain is at the middle of the square and 2 very modern big sculptures at its sides: Viaje Fantastico by Roberto Fabelo and  Escultura Natura by Juan Narcisco Quintanilla. A lot of coffee shops with live music together with the street musicians keep the place vivid all the time."
Positive,1,Restored and beautiful squareFantastic old square to see some of the old buildings in their restored fashion. Great for sipping a cocktail and people watching.
Positive,1,"comes to life at nighta fun place to stroll around after dark, stop off at a few of the bars and enjoy a drink, some music and dancing."
Positive,1,"Hot, muggy, and crowdedWe travelled to Havana in July 2019.   That was the only opportunity for us so we accepted the hot and muggy weather that goes with July.   Plaza Veija was very interestng and, in my jugdgment, required a guide to know what you were seeing.   The rich history of Cuba is on display in all of the different homes and businesses there now.  Many of the Cuban people were anxious to speak to tourists and even within obvious constraints talk about Cuban politics.Very enjoyable and worth doing.  Enjoy!"
Positive,1,Nice plazaA very nice plaza to visit in the middle of the old town! Great places to drink and eat near the plaza as well :)
Positive,1,"COLOURFUL PLAZAA beautifully colourful, architecturally eclectic square that apparently used to be the site of processions, executions, fiestas and bullfights. It is situated in Old Havana, that was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. I love architecture, so I found the different architectural styles quite fascinating."
Positive,1,"what a wonderful squareThe colours, the historic buildings, the people and the live music make this a must-visit square in old Havana. Some good restaurants. Lovely by day and by night. Need to visit."
Positive,1,"ColorfulHere you will see the perfect combination of colorful buildings and beautiful Cabrio cars! Of course, relaxed and not in the way of the Western World."
Positive,1,"Walking through historyEvery turn provided a new building, a new site, a new piece of history.  I spent an hour just walking the perimeter, taking in every aspect of the square.  My photos do not come close to projecting the true beauty of Plaza Vieja."
Positive,1,"Very Happy atmosphereMany places to eat, most of them good, a lot of live music, must try the street vendors,is close to the port, so due to the Cruise Ships is always full, also must see the Cathedral and other old buildings"
Positive,1,Beautiful Historic SquareA lovely square with a great deal of history.  Be sure to have a guide explain the architecture and the history of the buildings as well as what the buildings and square are used for now.  Lots of cafes in the area.
Positive,1,"My favorite square - colorful, sculptures, Cafe Escorial, brewery, and Camara OscuraOf the 4 principal squares of Old Havana, this one has the most character. It is worth a stop for coffee, beer, or just watching the world go by whether from street level or from the Camara Oscura."
Positive,1,"NiceNice, walk along the malecón is always  vibrant. A must see sight. Very peaceful and relaxing around the edge of Havana"
Positive,1,"Stunning little square with plenty going onWe visited Plaza Vieja a few times during our stay in Havana, it is a really lovely little square with plenty of going on. I could sit here for hours watching the world go by. Especially with a beer in my hand from the delightful little micro brewery in the square. There are plenty of shops and restaurants around the square and when we return to Havana in the future we are hoping to stay somewhere in Plaza Vieja itself to get the most out of what it has to offer."
Positive,1,Pleasant squareWe had an overnight stay on our cruise. On the second day we just walked around the area to see what it was like after our bus trip the 1st day. Although a lot of things we saw show varying signs of decay this square was very pleasant and a great photo opportunity.
Positive,1,"Loved everything about The squareWe loved everything about Havana and the square. Nice place to sit, people watch and listen to music!"
Positive,1,Beautiful old world architectureNice and easy walking distance from the cruise port make this an easy step back in time.  Great architecture.
Positive,1,"Worth a few hours at the very least...I'm so glad we spent time walking the plaza, in the rain, no less.  The sculptures are unique and unexpected.  La Habana Vieja is pristine even when crumbling, and the blend of ancient and modern feels otherworldly.  My children loved the mannequin artists, frozen in their costumes.  Young students were practicing their instruments in nearby cafes, sounding like musical prodigies.  This is a magical city and worth a visit to the old square.  If you can have a Cuban give you tour, it will be that much better.  Enjoy!"
Positive,1,Recommend it!The old town square is a must see!During the day you can see hundreds of children playing and jumping around as they use the square when they have gym class. This beautiful square is a perfect stop for a drink and just to relax and watch other people. Drinks on second floor balcony approx 2-3 CuC for beer/soft drink
Positive,1,"Beautiful place to loiter and let the magic of the place seep inCharming square with a terrific atmosphere coming off the busy thoroughfares. Its bones originated in 1559 and has a surround of colonnaded arcades providing vital shade from from intense glare of the sun and provide perfect angles to take best  camera shots . Points of interest. They all are: Camera Obscura, high tech Planatorium , Centre for development of Visual arts, the eye-catching Casa del Conde Jaruco  and the beautiful Palacio Cueto, a gorgeous Art Deco hotel.   There is a fountain to anchor the middle of the square which bears the crest of The Count of Santa Clara and the crest of the city. Lounge in the restaurants and coffee. This is a beautiful place to let the magic of history seep in."
Positive,1,Cadid shots rideThis square is ideal for a candid shots ride. A professional photographer would be of great help. You only have to worry about not falling from your cloud where you are sailing while the expert takes care of the shots .
Positive,1,"Plaza Vieja is  of Old Havanas 4 Lively squaresPlaza Vieja is right in the middle of old Havana.  Alway full of people enjoying the 360 views.  Several restaurants, Art Museums a must see Camera Obscurer. With the Art Biennial going on there were art objects in the Square.  A great restaurant close by in Mojito Mojito. Very clean, reasonable prices and super 4 o5 piece bands."
Positive,1,"Beautiful City Square Surrounded by Classic ArchitectureThis square is inside the pedestrian zone so no cars to worry about. We were told by our cruise presenter beforehand that there is a primary school on this square & at recess, the children just come outside to play - & that's just what they did. It feels like quintessential 'Old Habana' - people walking to work or walking their kids to school. Very safe & relatively clean too. On one corner (northeast, I think) stands the Historic Hotel Raquel - a jewish hotel, we were surprised to learn; another building frozen in time w/ beautiful architecture, a classic antique/old-style elevator, & a friendly staff (even if you're not staying there). Go inside & have a cafe Cubano or Cuba Libre at the bar & people-watch in the lobby for a bit!"
Positive,1,Very nice squareThis is of the three historians squares in old Havana. It is very vibrant. It is surrounded by beautiful buildings. It is definitely worth a visit.
Negative,0,"Old placeThe old place, have many fashion and tupical bar and restaurant.  Salsa  music in all bar and restaurant. Thery nice place."
Negative,0,Very difficult to walkWe had maps but cuba does not replace fallen street signs. About 90% are gone. Streets are in disrepair. Open potholes everywhere. The sewage smell is terrible.
Negative,0,The usual dirty Cuba siteThis place like the rest of Cuba was filthy and sad. Hanging dirty unwear on lines. A very poor sad country. The guide was proud of country and pollution too.
Negative,0,I will not take my coffee here!It was my 3rd time in Havanna and many things have changed. I remembered Plaza Vieja for good coffee - and maybe the coffee is still okay but it is far too expensive (compared to other places) and while we were having our coffee we were being surrounded with all kinds of people asking for money. I fully understand that they need money - and that we have so much more than they have - but I dont like the way we were being approached. Very intimidating - very offensive. We left again very fast.
Negative,0,"Perhaps only place, not completely run down, but very little to offer.Most of the places are state run.... very poor food, very poorly maintained, very poor service. I will never go back to Cuba"
Negative,0,"It's CubaSave yourself some $$$ and go somewhere like St. Augustine, FL.  Cuba is a dump with Che's picture all over the place.  The people are lazy and you just don't feel safe."
Negative,0,"FabulousAnother square or piazza you will cross many times in old Havana, this square links you to many wonderful streets with lots of characters, great architecture, bars and restaurants, the square itself has restaurants and also bed and breakfasts also."
Negative,0,"Pretty but full of touristsThe restaurants are overpriced and mediocre. The music is all catered to tourists (covers of Buena Vista Social Club songs). It's pretty so definitely walk through it. And it's a good place to meet up with someone or get your bearings. But I wouldn't order more than a cup of coffee or tea. The brewhouse is there. Everyone had their giant towers of beer, but we didn't try it."
Negative,0,"PickpockettedSo..... my visit was coloured by a bad experience of having my cell phone stolen out of my pocket, but I should have known better. The Square itself is charming & if you're into people watching, - & American vintage car watching- it's a great place to be."
Negative,0,One of few tourist trapsThe square might be one of few tourist traps in Havanna. The square main restaurant (might actually just be one) is crowded with tourists and the quality is poor while the prices are (fairly) high.
Negative,0,"Lunchtime with the dogs and catsAfter a tour of the city we needed a drink, food and rest. This restaurant appeared in a lovely square.Ordered 2 burgers as unsure about the cooking methods of the chicken kebabs which were being served and popular.Burgers were like putty and left a terrible taste in the mouth. I ended up feeding the cats and dogs and praying we didn't end up ill.Strange taste from beer.Ultimately no food health issues, I just wouldn't go back."
Negative,0,"very tiredVery disappointing as all the waiters and waitresses were very tired - no one wanted to serve you, everything had run out - except the little bar on the corner.  If you don't mind being overrun with lots of other tourists you may enjoy - not the night life you expect of the promises made in the well thumbed brochures"
Negative,0,"Blah, blah - ho humNice colonial square, but lots of tourist shop rip-offs, and crowded with street performers, and potential pick-pockets. Not much else to say. It it were nto part fo the standard old-city tour, I would not go specially just for this square"
Negative,0,Old SquareNot such a big deal.  There was one building that was painted and looked decent but the rest was old and dirty looking.  They had some vendors and music in part of the square but nothing that would keep you there more than 15 minutes or so.  Maybe to sit and have a drink but you can do that at your resort for free.
Negative,0,Commercial Restaurant AreaThis place was a tourist area busy with overpriced outdoor dining. Other parts of Havana have a lot more charm.
Negative,0,Great place to sit and watch the world go byPerfect place to sit and listen to all the wonderful music and performances of the many street artists.
Negative,0,"Clean sterile,Looks like new. No ""Ambiente"" at all. It is a pity that the old feeling is not there anymore. Maybe some more democracy in Cuba?"
Negative,0,"Old Square?I trust i could have been kept and hold differently.Nice buildings, but why does t shows itself like it's the newest one instead?"
Negative,0,disappointedApart from the only restaurant with a resident band this square lacked buzz. A nice water feature in the middle of the square had a huge permanent high fence all around. The walk to the square was far more interesting than the square itself.
Negative,0,"Not much there but expensivwe shopsWe went there but did not stay long as there was really nothing there but some expensive clothing stores. If you are looking for some clothes or shoes then this is a good place for you. When I was booking our Casa I noticed many Casa owners saying they were close to this square, but where you want to be is near Obispo street."
Negative,0,If you like waiting ....We didn't believe the reviews .... but they were right! The bars in this square have appallingly slow service .... and we were in no rush. There are better places to chill out.
Negative,0,"A Square in transitionThe Old Square is about as touristy as Havana gets. The people working the tourists are delightful and not overly pushy, but they do not have much to offer in the way of anything interesting. The Square is being updated and upgraded, but it has a long way to go. there are a few restaurants around the square, but again, nothing special. This review however should not stop you from visiting Havana or Old Square Plaza. It is all part of the experience. Stop and talk to the people. they are wonderful and very receptive to any appraoch to talk."
Negative,0,"The Tourism TrapDespite the other reviews saying that this is a 'lovely place to hang out' especially in the Beer house, just remember that over 30 families were evicted from their life long homes to make way for a PRIVATE enterprise. Despite it giving somewhere for tourists to sit and have a cooling drink, I personally would prefer to rub shoulders with the locals, not stamp them out! Also, I thought I was coming to a communist country where everyone was equal. But definately not! The 'upgrade' to the square has taken away all of its charm and yet one more corner of Habana is santised for the tourists. (I am all for preserving the natural charm and beauty of this Unesco Heritage city, but at a cost to high IMO.) PS the cost of a beer here is as much as a Cuban earns in a month. :("
Negative,0,the beer factorybeer is good.  food is awfull  The only decent thing was the shish kabobs.  The fish was very fishy.  wild cats running around the outdoor tables begging for food scraps
Negative,0,"TouristicThe only square in Havana which is really too touristic. Too much pushy Cubans, it's all about money....."
Negative,0,"breweryfor terrible service of a truly comedic level, have a 2/3 full pint of beer in the little microbrew brew on the square. not really the square's fault."
Negative,0,"It's nothing exciting over thereWe visited the Havana's Club Museum which is located in the old havana area , and we weren't impressed at all. However, my family and I took a tour bus all around old Havana, Center of Havana where all nice hotel such National hotel are located, and East of Havana such Miramar, and we had a lot of fun. In addition, we paid only $5 for this two hour tour."
Negative,0,"Tourist TrapFood and service was awful. Very pretty stop. Good for photos, bad for food."
Negative,0,"Over-renovated, or in a state of transition?I was disappointed with the Plaza Vieja, to which I had been looking forward.  The problem was that the square had recently been renovated and, whilst the architecture of the buildings was generally beautiful, the locals had not got back into it to give to give it some soul - it was a bit of a spotless desert, so out of keeping with the rest of the old town."
Negative,0,"The square is beautiful, but that's it.Beautiful in the square and up to two blocks or blocks around. From there to there it is just ruins, poverty and dirty streets. People wanting to take advantage of tourists too."
Negative,0,"Great place to watch Cuba go byWe were lucky enough to have an overnight stay in Havana whilst on a cruise in January.The Old Square is very easy to find from the cruise port and has a lovely Plaza.The best bit, is there are several Bar / Resuarants on the Plaza that have open balconies on the first floor, which allow you to have a drink or food and watch life in the Plaza go by.Havana is a fascinating place and the Old Square is ideal for a taste."
