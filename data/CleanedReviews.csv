Negative,0,cheap but mediocregood locat next to faberg√© museum which make it veri busi and crowd expect to wait for a tabl restaur is pleasant and waitress delight howev thi restaur which special in dumpl from italian ravioli to gioza to russian dumpl etc is quit low in qualiti and the dumpl are mediocr even though quit cheap
Negative,0,poor servic they serv me my dessert without one of the ingredi and when i ask they were quit rude about it i ask if they could add the ingredi but they said they ran out it wa a key ingredi and the dessert wa veri bland and quit expens without it they want to offer me a 10 discount or i could return it i end up not get the discount and they ad an extra servic charg to our bill i guess a reveng for my complaint my friend who were sit at a separ tabl found glass in their food and did not receiv the extra servic charg all in all veri weird and the food wa mediocr at best
Negative,0,disappoint i don t understand whi peopl rave about thi place went here with two friend base on the tripadvisor rate and all three of u were thoroughli disappoint we had pelmeni and varenniki with cherri the dough in both wa way too thick and doughi and while the cherri fill wa good the meat fill wa mediocr i m complet baffl i sure hope there are better dumpl place in st petersburg
Negative,0,i don t recommendpelmeni wa normal like ani other ordinari restaur waitress total careless they were more busi with their cellphon long wait time to find tabl veri limit choic of food and beverag no option to have cocktail drink they offer me to do it by myself weird
Negative,0,i wa not allow to speak i did not even enter thi restaur i will not comment the food a i have not tri it but i believ a restaur is not onli food but mostli servic we tri to enter it on a thursday even but the staff who wa at the front door wa extrem impolit when i put my foot into the restaur i tri to ask if there wa a tabl avail but befor conclud my sentenc she wildli gestur that the restaur wa full okay then i tri to ask her if we could wait for a tabl and how long that would take but onc again she did not allow me to conclud my sentenc she wa not interest in new guest afteral the place wa full great way to welcom possibl new guest if i could i would give 0 zero star but onc that is not possibl i will give pelmenya 1 like a thank becaus we then decid to go to yat restaur and we had a fabul dinner there
Negative,0,not good a i expectedmani peopl recommend u to tri russian dumpl and we chose here to have the experi of local food not mani choic of food you can select all is the same tast i found it quit bore and bland not feel it is good
Negative,0,aw servicethi place is in the st petersburg center near anichkov bridg while it ha good review for the food we didn t manag to tri it the servic wa aw when we arriv we just wait at the entranc no one even bother that we were there then a waitress approach and told u briefli wait ok we thought if she s so brief then it should be quick after a while noth chang we were just stand at the entranc make peopl which were eat feel uncomfi so we ask anoth waitress how long we need to wait she repli 20 minut at least could you tell u thi inform from the start we immedi left the place my advic would be to eat there onli if it s half empti and you don t have to wait at the entranc with no one care about you otherwis pleas go further far from the center you will find better and cheaper food place with cheer stuff wait to help you and make you feel welcom
Negative,0,cheap food cheaper tast servic is aw and slow if you order lunch might a well prepar to eat it by dinner what about the food though they onli have manti khinkali and other from the same line of food think so are they special far from it the tast is a blend a a fruit smoothi the dough from the khinkali came partial raw and appar they have quit a lot of oil to use in their food besid be fri you expect it to be partial crunchi the khinkali came soft and mushi the tast of the fill is overpow and strong enough to the point you can bare eat more than one fork of it the aperitif though seem to be much better a the mozzarella with tomato and basil came a good a you could expect for the price rang besid be quit oili a well they are not intern readi a the drink menu sometim ha no english translat and the staff had a hard time understand me and commun result in one dish come wrongli they are quit friendli and tri their best though had no problem chang the dish without addit charg have i mention that even the dessert is oili thi place should watch out a trump may give them some freedom for the oil for an almost 5 star rate restaur on trip advisor the fame might have overpow them and the food qualiti came low a fast a the rate went high or the peopl food tast is just dubit would i recommend not even if you have no money to eat there are better and healthier consid the amount of oil they use here fast food and bakeri for the same price rang would i come back unless i need to fri some potato with my blood afterward nop oh and should i warn you the beer is warmer than my bath water
Negative,0,worst servic ever we arriv at 22h the restaur close at 23h they kept push me and my boyfriend to choos fast and sinc the menu ha no clear explan about each kind of dumpl we were look onlin to decid alreadi veri annoy the food arriv and the tast is good but when we were still eat the woman told u we are close and put the bill in our tabl without ask f we want someth els they made u pay befor we finish eat and yo make thing wors it wa my birthday so i want desert to celebr it and they were almost kick u out and dont ask for the ravi√≥li becaus it is cold and raw
